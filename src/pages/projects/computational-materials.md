title: Dirac Electron in IrGa and Magnetism in FeGa

abstract: >-
  The goal of our project is to find new semiconducting materials through
  simulating electronic behavior in new theoretical materials. Essentially, we
  are looking for a replacement for silicon that can be used in microchips and
  tuned to fit different needs and specifications. We use a simulation software
  called Wein2k, which uses Density Functional Theory, a method which solves the
  mathematical equations from the ground up that define how electrons behave.
  The simulation generates data about the electron behavior (particularly, the
  Density of States and the Bandstructure) which tell us all sorts of things
  about how the material will behave in the physical world. Join us on a journey
  through quantum mechanics, solid state physics, and materials science as we
  look into electron behavior in materials that has never been seen before!

  - body: "\n\n\n\nWe started the day by working on simulating changes in pressure conditions around the IrGa lattice. This is done by changing the volume of the unit cell in small increments (about 1% of the unit cell's total volume) and running the simulation again and again using each new variation to examine changes in the density of states and the bandstructure. Why is this important? Thanks to Boyle's law, we know that a change in pressure always corresponds with a change in volume. Since pressure is a physical value that can be easily adjusted in the real world, we know that any change in volume corresponds to a real, physical parameter which can be easily tuned. Therefore, if we find that altering the volume has some useful effect (for example changing the Fermi energy), then we know that this makes our potential material more flexible to fit different needs and specifications. This is part of an area of materials science known as \"band tuning.\"\r\n\nThe structural aspect of this process was completed today. The unit cell of IrGa was edited in vesta, and 10 .cif files were exported. Since the original volume of one IrGa unit cell is 27.108 Å3 , each subsequent .cif file has a volume .27108 Å3 smaller than the previous.\r\n\nBelow are images from VESTA of the first two iterations of this process:\n\n![](/img/screen-shot-2019-08-26-at-2.48.11-pm.png)\n\n![](/img/screen-shot-2019-08-26-at-2.48.39-pm.png)\n\nThe day was ended with a student-led lecture on band theory, and the meaning of bandstructure and Density of States. \n\n![](/img/screen-shot-2019-08-26-at-2.50.14-pm.png)\n\n![](/img/screen-shot-2019-08-26-at-2.50.22-pm.png)"
