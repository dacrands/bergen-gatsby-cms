title: Dirac Electron in IrGa and Magnetism in FeGa

abstract: >-
  The goal of our project is to find new semiconducting materials through
  simulating electronic behavior in new theoretical materials. Essentially, we
  are looking for a replacement for silicon that can be used in microchips and
  tuned to fit different needs and specifications. We use a simulation software
  called Wein2k, which uses Density Functional Theory, a method which solves the
  mathematical equations from the ground up that define how electrons behave.
  The simulation generates data about the electron behavior (particularly, the
  Density of States and the Bandstructure) which tell us all sorts of things
  about how the material will behave in the physical world. Join us on a journey
  through quantum mechanics, solid state physics, and materials science as we
  look into electron behavior in materials that has never been seen before!

  - body: "We started the day by working on simulating changes in pressure conditions around the IrGa lattice. This is done by changing the volume of the unit cell in small increments (about 1% of the unit cell's total volume) and running the simulation again and again using each new variation to examine changes in the density of states and the bandstructure. Why is this important? Thanks to Boyle's law, we know that a change in pressure always corresponds with a change in volume. Since pressure is a physical value that can be easily adjusted in the real world, we know that any change in volume corresponds to a real, physical parameter which can be easily tuned. Therefore, if we find that altering the volume has some useful effect (for example changing the Fermi energy), then we know that this makes our potential material more flexible to fit different needs and specifications. This is part of an area of materials science known as \"band tuning.\"\n\nThe structural aspect of this process was completed today. The unit cell of IrGa was edited in vesta, and 10 .cif files were exported. Since the original volume of one IrGa unit cell is 27.108 Å3 , each subsequent .cif file has a volume .27108 Å3 smaller than the previous.\n\nBelow are images from VESTA of the first two iterations of this process:\n\n![](/img/screen-shot-2019-08-26-at-2.48.11-pm.png)\n\n![](/img/screen-shot-2019-08-26-at-2.48.39-pm.png)\n\nThe day was ended with a student-led lecture on band theory, and the meaning of bandstructure and Density of States. \n\n![](/img/screen-shot-2019-08-26-at-2.50.14-pm.png)\n\n![](/img/screen-shot-2019-08-26-at-2.50.22-pm.png)\n\nThe other goal for this week is to conduct literature review regarding phases of FeGa. \n\n**Definitions for this entry:** \n\n* **Lattice** - the pattern in which the atoms are arranged in the overall crystal structure. \n\n\\*note: in the context of crystals, a lattice is almost always considered to have some sort of translational symmetry\n\n* **Unit Cell** - one single iteration of atoms making up the overall pattern of the lattice. These can be simple cubes or large complex structures, but the important thing is that they all share the same basis. \n* **Fermi Energy** - the energy level at which electrons escape the valence band and enter the conduction band\n* **.cif files** - files which contain structural information about the unit cell\n  .\n* **Bandstructure** – graph of electron energy levels vs. momentum space. These graphs tell us the paths that electrons are taking through the unit cell, and their corresponding energy levels. Each point on the x-axis corresponds to a point in the unit cell (see figure 3).\n\n\\*note: the “point” that the bandstructure graphs correspond to are not actual locations. This is thanks to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which states that we cannot know both the position and velocity of an electron at the same time. Therefore, these graphs occur in what is known as “momentum space.” But don’t worry too much about this! For the purposes of the reader, we can think of it as physical locations.\n\n* **Density of States** – graph of the number of electron states vs. energy level. These graphs tell us how many different electron states can occupy a particular energy level. \n\nIt was observed in the bandstructure of IrGa that there is something called a Dirac point. This is essentially a point in the unit cell where electrons are moving at velocities up to magnitudes of millions of times higher than everywhere else in the structure. Therefore, special relativity must be taken into account, and the electrons can only be described using something called the Dirac equation (hence the name) and no longer can be described by the Schrodinger equation, which holds for any quantum system that doesn’t contain particles moving at relativistic speeds.\n\nThe discovery of this Dirac point is enough to write a paper and publish it in a journal! However, it is not enough to simply show a graph and say “this is a Dirac point!” We must also prove that the Dirac point exists there theoretically, using the math of quantum mechanics and previous research.\n\n![](/img/screen-shot-2019-08-26-at-3.01.46-pm.png)\n\nBecause of this, I was assigned by our mentor to read the paper “Three-Dimensional Dirac Semimetals: Design principles and predictions of new materials.” Not only would this paper give me more ideas about how to prove that the Dirac point exists in IrGa, but would also help me understand the types of 3D Dirac semimetals, how to search for them computationally, and how they differ from topological insulators and Weyl semimetals (other types of materials with relativistic electrons \\[or to get technical, materials with massless spin- ½  Dirac fermions]). \n\n**Below are the notes I took while reading this paper:**\n\nLiterature Review: Reading \"Three-dimensional Dirac Semimetals: Design principles and predictions of new materials\"\n\n* **Goals: How to look for new Dirac Semimetals**\n\no\tTypes of compounds which produce 3D DSM's\n\no\tWhy Dirac Cones are created\n\n* **3 Types:**\n\no\tCharge balanced dirac semimetals\n\no\torbital degenericies\n\no\tglide planes and screw axes\n\n* **Charge Balanced 3D Dirac semimetals are \"in between\" topological and regular insulators**\n* **Special state where bands are totally insulated except for special points of high symmetry**\n\no\tUsually form in materials with large SOC\n\no\tbands must have different symmetries\n\n•\twhen 2 bands touch, either:\n\no\tavoided crossing > topological insulator\n\no\tavoided crossing > regular insulator\n\no\tcrossing points gap out except for special points along crystal symmetry > 3D DSM\n\n* ^ **These outcomes controlled by \"point group\" symmetry.**\n* **When the gap closes, electronic states must be orthogonal to each other.**\n\no\tHowever, with SOC, orthogonality comes from the \"double group.\" \n\n\tdouble group: Point group that also takes into account that the states are spin-1/2 particles.\n\n\tExample: C2v > irreducible > all states have the same symmetry.\n\n\twithout SOC, C2v has four different irreducible representations. \n\n\tSo, states crossing must have different symmetries in the double group.\n\n\tthis can only exist in C3, C4, and C6 symmetries. \n\no\tAll of this rules out all orthorhombic, monoclinic, and triclininc space groups from being charged balanced 3D Dirac semimetals.\n\n* **For cubic DSMs:**\n\no\tDirac point along gamma-R line, which is along a threefold rotation axis with C3v symmetry.\n\n\tPossible because of band inversion along this line and large SOC (which exists in IrGa!)\n\n\tCan use this as a source when proving our material!!!!\n\n* **Teaching new members**\n\nJean Pierre and I spent a good portion of today teaching new members how to use the Wein2k code to generate DOS (Density of States) and bandstructure graphs. We ran the material Fe3Ga4 for practice, which is a material which Jean Pierre has been focusing on in order to investigate ferromagnetism in the material. We talked through the process while Leike and Nami took notes.\n\n![](/img/screen-shot-2019-08-26-at-3.09.27-pm.png)\n\n![](/img/screen-shot-2019-08-26-at-3.09.35-pm.png)\n\nIn the end, there was an issue with the bandstructure graph (Figure 7). The vertical white space is not supposed to be there. Well, troubleshooting is a large part of the battle in computational physics! Unfortunately, we ran out of time and need to continue tomorrow."
