  The electronic behavior of novel binary systems is studied computationally
  using Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods. Electronic band structure and
  density of states are investigated in the Ir-Ga and Fe-Ga systems using the
  wein2k code package. This research aims to find novel semiconductors with
  useful attributes such as high carrier mobility while simultaneously serving
  as a search for new Dirac semimetals.
