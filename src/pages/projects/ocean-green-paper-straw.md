      This is the very last week of summer two, however, our group is planning
      on coming in for further observations and testing on the paper straws that
      we obtained. The next step is to see exactly how long each companies straw
      lasts in cold and room temperature liquids. We are planning to set up a
      timelapse video to show the duration of time that passes before the straws
      are completely unusable. As for sogginess of the straw, we are researching
      ways where the fail time can be determined more efficiently.

      The group started to test the durability of each straw from 3 of the 6
      different companies we ordered straws from. This included Eagle Straw,
      Aardvark, and OK Straw. When starting the test, we instantly noticed that
      the straws deteriorated within minutes once it was in contact with hot
      water. They lasted about 3 minutes before completely unraveling. As for
      the straws sitting in room temperature and cold temperature liquids, they
      did not unravel but instead, they became soggy after 5 min of inserting
      them into the water. The sogginess levels varied depending on the
      temperature. This showed us that the consumer's claims about the existing
      paper straws on the market do not last nearly as long as they claim to
      last.

      Straws from six different companies were ordered this week. The company's
      we ordered form include, Aardvark, OK Straw, Eagle Straw, Tutti Party,
      Harvest Pack, and Comfy Package. We purposefully purchased plain white
      straws from 3 companies and striped straws from the remaining 3 companies
      to test whether the durability could possibly be reliant on the pattern. 
      To our surprise, Aardvark sent us a sample pack of 24 plain white drinking
      straws instead of a variety pack of their different types of straws.
      Whereas OK straw sent us a 50 pack of all their different patterned straws
      and many even had different diameters. This enables us to have the
      opportunity to test where the diameter of the paper straw has anything to
      do with its life span in liquids, which was not previously considered.

  - body: "This week, we focused on gathering information about other existing paper straws on the market, preferably from American based companies. We are keeping allergens and waxes in mind while searching for paper straws to test to ensure that the criteria of each straw we are testing is relevant to one another.\r\n\nFree straw samples from two American based companies we're ordered this week. A sample pack from aardvark and OK straw."

      The second week of summer 2 marks the beginning of our new project OCEAN
      GREEN STRAW. This project will focus on solving the shortcomings of paper
      straws from the top paper straw manufacturer in the United States,
      Aardvark, and review the problems of their product to create a
      longer-lasting, safer paper straw. The group started by gathering
      questions that we would like to answer about existing paper straws. For
      instance, how long do the paper straws actually last in liquids? Are they
      dependent on the type of liquid? What temperatures can the product
      withstand? Can it hold longer in room temperature or cold? The group
      currently only consists of 2 individuals, Erin and Patrycja, as of now. We
      are on the lookout for people with a background in organic chemistry who
      is interested in joining the project.
