  In this project we build robot for the VEX competition which happens 
                                           every year. In this project all the members get to understand and work 
                                           with the important skills like 3D designing, programming, assembling                              
                                            of the component in the robot and many more.

      On July 15, Tyler and Deepa was working on the extension part for the arm
      and motors to the super structure. However, we had to reconfigure some of
      the mechanism which took us all day to figure out. We did figure out what
      was causing the issue, but we were not able to finish the work today. We
      will hopefully continue working on it to finish if we do not encounter any
      issues.


      The motors and the gear we used for the extension arm was not
      complimenting each other. Deepa was watching videos and researching how
      people solved the problems. Tyler went to the Tech building and got the
      four pieces cut needed for the arm extension. Deepa also worked on the arm
      and completed it.


      Deepa finished working on the cube stacked mechanism. This is a new
      mechanism we are trying this summer, in the process of making it, we were
      researching, watching videos to understand the mechanism and to modify it.
      Issue came across with a test to actually lift the superstructure, looking
      into replacing motors with stronger ones.


      On Thursday, Tyler worked on attaching the extension arm to the robot.
      Deepa finished working on the stacker.

      In summer one, we finished working on building the solid base and the
      support for the arms. I(Deepa) spent most of the time on Monday working on
      improving some parts of robot and started working on building mechanism
      for picking up the cubes.


      Work picked up and I (Tyler) started focusing on parts needed for future
      attachment such as the lifting mechanism, cube intake method, and
      adjustments needed for the lifting mechanism. For the rest of Tuesday I 
      also prepared the purchase request forum for tools.


      On Wednesday, Tyler and Deepa was working on the support for the arms of
      the robot. During the process we encounter some of the issues with the
      arms which was not allowing the arms to move efficiently. We researched
      and try to apply different mechanism to solve the problem but none of the
      method was helping. So we spent all day working on solving the problem.


      On Thursday, Deepa was working on extending parts of an arm. As well Tyler
      was working on the mechanism to lift both arms of the superstructure so
      orientation of both gears go in the right direction.

      I spent all Monday researching the concept for the robot and the rules for
      the VEX competition 2019-2020 tower takeover.

      I finished working on the base today and now I am researching about the
      VEX competition for 2019- 2020. 


      The registration date for the VEX competition was already closed. I was
      researching the different options for us to have a competition. I spent
      the whole day researching about the college and the competition they are
      having in their colleges.


      I reached out to some of the school for the competition but those
      competition was only for the middle and high school. I was still
      researching about the colleges and other options which we can use our
      robot for.


      On Thursday we decided that we will build our robot based on the
      requirement of the VEX competition and we will use that robot for the
      scrimmage if any college are available.

      It is the first day of the internship for the summer of 2019. We spent
      most of our day transferring the robotics stuff in the new STEMatics room.


      The stuff which we were not able to transfer to the new room, we
      transferred in the next day. Most of our day we spent it in organizing the
      stuff.


      On Wednesday, we organized bits and pieces of the metal and the tools. The
      tools and the metal pieces we have was not easily accessible. we spent the
      day making the working place clutter free. We also discussed about how to
      manage the tools and organize all the stuff so that it is easily
      accessible to everyone


      Since I am only one doing the internship, I spent most of the day working
      on the base of our robot. According to my plan I am planning to work on
      the base first and make it more stable.

      Deepa finished half of the stacker mechanism. I was trying to attach the
      stacker mechanism to the robot and was trying to build an extension
      mechanism to the stacker, but I was having trouble with it. Tyler worked
      preparing the game piece to help with experimentation for the robot with
      3D printing of the cube.


      Deepa was working on the stacker and I spent the whole Tuesday working on
      it. However, I could not figure out the extension for the stacker and I
      was having trouble with attaching it. 


      The mechanism Deepa and Tyler is working for the robot is almost done
      however, we were having trouble fixing minor problems. The stacking
      mechanism Deepa has been working on was not functionable because there was
      no grip for the cube to stay in the stacker and the stacking of cube
      requires extra push to extend the stacker. Deepa was trying to understand
      how that mechanism will work and spend the whole day researching. As well
      Chalres and Tyler focused on a new idea of the chassis and made it similar
      to that of Cherry and Blueberry.


      Deepa tried to experiment with different mechanism for the stacker to work
      properly. Tyler had completed the first piece of the VEX game piece and is
      preparing for next week to print the other half. As well as fixing issues
      with the electronics from changing the chassis of the robot.
