  In this project we build robot for the VEX competition which happens 
                                           every year. In this project all the members get to understand and work 
                                           with the important skills like 3D designing, programming, assembling                              
                                            of the component in the robot and many more.

      I finished working on the base today and now I am researching about the
      VEX competition for 2019- 2020. 


      The registration date for the VEX competition was already closed. I was
      researching the different options for us to have a competition. I spent
      the whole day researching about the college and the competition they are
      having in their colleges.


      I reached out to some of the school for the competition but those
      competition was only for the middle and high school. I was still
      researching about the colleges and other options which we can use our
      robot for.


      On Thursday we decided that we will build our robot based on the
      requirement of the VEX competition and we will use that robot for the
      scrimmage if any college are available.

      It is the first day of the internship for the summer of 2019. We spent
      most of our day transferring the robotics stuff in the new STEMatics room.


      The stuff which we were not able to transfer to the new room, we
      transferred in the next day. Most of our day we spent it in organizing the
      stuff.


      On Wednesday, we organized bits and pieces of the metal and the tools. The
      tools and the metal pieces we have was not easily accessible. we spent the
      day making the working place clutter free. We also discussed about how to
      manage the tools and organize all the stuff so that it is easily
      accessible to everyone


      Since I am only one doing the internship, I spent most of the day working
      on the base of our robot. According to my plan I am planning to work on
      the base first and make it more stable.
