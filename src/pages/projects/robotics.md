  In this project we build robot for the VEX competition which happens 
                                           every year. In this project all the members get to understand and work 
                                           with the important skills like 3D designing, programming, assembling                              
                                            of the component in the robot and many more.

      The mechanism for the robot was almost finished.  On Monday, Tyler and
      Deepa are hoping to finish attaching stacking and extender mechanism.
      However,  we were encountering the problems which was not allowing the
      extender mechanism for the movement.


      Tyler was trying to provide more space for the extender to function
      properly. Deepa was working on researching about the problems we
      encounter.

      The superstructure for the robot is now complete and the attachment went
      on smoothly. There are some issues with weight, but we believe we resolved
      it by removing extra metal that was not necessary for the superstructure
      to function.

      The superstructure of the robot was finished and Tyler and Deepa was
      trying to figure out the programming for the robot. We were having trouble
      with wiring and the coding so we were researching and trying to figure out
      the way to make it work.

      Deepa looked into the lifting mechanism and had made possible ideas to use
      a 3d printed parts that will hold the cube in. This will be in combination
      with an older design used by our group to hold it in place. As well Tyler
      had got the second piece of the cube began printing today and should
      finish tomorrow seeing as it will take 19 hours to finish.


      Tyler focused on setting up the intake mechanism movement function that we
      had initially intended to give an extra distance from the main chassis.
      This is added to avoid any collisions between the block and the interior
      electronics. 


      The intake mechanism had to be reinforced in order to make sure the
      opening would remain a square. As well the metal on it had to be switched
      out due to height issues.

      Deepa finished half of the stacker mechanism. I was trying to attach the
      stacker mechanism to the robot and was trying to build an extension
      mechanism to the stacker, but I was having trouble with it. Tyler worked
      preparing the game piece to help with experimentation for the robot with
      3D printing of the cube.


      Deepa was working on the stacker and I spent the whole Tuesday working on
      it. However, I could not figure out the extension for the stacker and I
      was having trouble with attaching it. 


      The mechanism Deepa and Tyler is working for the robot is almost done
      however, we were having trouble fixing minor problems. The stacking
      mechanism Deepa has been working on was not functionable because there was
      no grip for the cube to stay in the stacker and the stacking of cube
      requires extra push to extend the stacker. Deepa was trying to understand
      how that mechanism will work and spend the whole day researching. As well
      Chalres and Tyler focused on a new idea of the chassis and made it similar
      to that of Cherry and Blueberry.


      Deepa tried to experiment with different mechanism for the stacker to work
      properly. Tyler had completed the first piece of the VEX game piece and is
      preparing for next week to print the other half. As well as fixing issues
      with the electronics from changing the chassis of the robot.

  - body: "\n\nThe metal I used to protect the wheel was not supporting the arm of the robot. It was weakening the stability of the base. Therefore, I dismantle the base to try something different.\n\n![](/img/screen-shot-2019-08-26-at-2.11.43-pm.png)\n\nI use the C- channel this time and Tyler helped me to finish the base and it seems stable and strong. We are going to continue with the base and work on the arm and the body part of the robot.\n\n![](/img/screen-shot-2019-08-26-at-2.13.28-pm.png)\n\nThe C- Channel I used to protect the wheels is making the side of the base more rigid then before and the angle at the middle is also giving support to maintain the rigidity equally throughout the base.\n\nOn Thursday, I continue working on the body part of the robot. I build the support for the lifting and the sliding mechanism. This is a new mechanism I am trying this summer. \r\n\n![](/img/screen-shot-2019-08-26-at-2.14.31-pm.png)"

      I was working on the arm part of the robot due to the instability of the
      robot I was struggling to make it stable. Due to the weight of an arm the
      base part of the robot was not stable as well. I spent most of the day
      trying to fix the problem, but I could not figure out the solutions.   


      I was trying to figure out the solution. During the process of assembling
      pieces and the adjustment seems a little bit less stable. I was
      encountering the same problem I got before. I tried to move the axel
      placement, metal supporter but it was not helping.  


      I was researching about the problem I was encountering and tried to find
      out what other people have done. At first almost all the people were
      having the same issue with the stability of the robot. In the animated
      video of the robot, the center of mass was not considered proper. However,
      that did not actually work on our robot. I was constantly researching and
      adjusting the placement of the metal piece in the robot hoping to solve
      the obstacle. 


      On Thursday, Tyler was working on the old robot to check whether it was
      working or not. Javier fixed the programming for that robot. We prepared
      for the presentation and worked on the old robot to showcase it in the
      presentation.

      I spent all Monday researching the concept for the robot and the rules for
      the VEX competition 2019-2020 tower takeover.


      The video I was watching for the ideas and the concept for the robot, it
      has a great feature for the robot. Implementing this concept on our robot
      we can collect more cubes and stack more cubes on the tower.


      <https://youtu.be/FJ7n5vcpsTw>


      I was experimenting the concept from the videos all Wednesday. Before
      attaching it to the robot I wanted to make sure I know the capabilities of
      the mechanism use for the stacking of cubes.

      I finished working on the base today and now I am researching about the
      VEX competition for 2019- 2020. 


      The registration date for the VEX competition was already closed. I was
      researching the different options for us to have a competition. I spent
      the whole day researching about the college and the competition they are
      having in their colleges.


      I reached out to some of the school for the competition but those
      competition was only for the middle and high school. I was still
      researching about the colleges and other options which we can use our
      robot for.


      On Thursday we decided that we will build our robot based on the
      requirement of the VEX competition and we will use that robot for the
      scrimmage if any college are available.

      It is the first day of the internship for the summer of 2019. We spent
      most of our day transferring the robotics stuff in the new STEMatics room.


      The stuff which we were not able to transfer to the new room, we
      transferred in the next day. Most of our day we spent it in organizing the
      stuff.


      On Wednesday, we organized bits and pieces of the metal and the tools. The
      tools and the metal pieces we have was not easily accessible. we spent the
      day making the working place clutter free. We also discussed about how to
      manage the tools and organize all the stuff so that it is easily
      accessible to everyone


      Since I am only one doing the internship, I spent most of the day working
      on the base of our robot. According to my plan I am planning to work on
      the base first and make it more stable.
