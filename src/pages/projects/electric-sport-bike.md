  The overall objective of the project is to design and construct a Brushless DC
  motor, with provisions made for regenerative braking, such that it can be used
  to drive an electric motorcycle. â€‹This consists of conducting research to
  understand the inner workings of an electric motor and the mechanics of a
  typical motorcycle. A solid understanding of the factors that contribute to
  the torque produced by the motor is essential in attempting to enhance the
  efficiency of this vehicle. The goal would be to achieve a speed of 80 miles
  per hour while conserving the charge of the batteries for as long as possible.

      The group manufactured 40 connectors for the battery pack out of a large
      copper sheet. Upon completion of connecting all the cells together, we
      noticed that we had two damaged cells. Upon realization of this, we
      decided to take apart the battery pack and replace the two damaged cells.

      Today we managed to complete the circuit connecting the motor to the
      controller. To construct the discharging unit, we cut holes in plywood for
      the Flange and was later mounted.  The discharging circuit was also
      completed and the group is working on a graph to track and display the
      voltage of the battery.

      The throttle that was purchased arrived with a couple manufacturing
      defects. The throttle was jamming and the wires were not extruded from the
      correct spot. To overcome this issue, we cut out a small hole were the
      wires would be pulled through and covered them with electrical tape to
      enable the throttle to move properly. The next thing we covered today was
      assembling and testing the discharging circuit. Calculations were also
      revised and it was found that at 10kW power usage the motor will be able
      to accelerate the motorcycle up to 27.5 m/s (61 mph).

      A safety kill switch was purchased along with fully insulated
      quick-disconnect terminals, steel pipe flange and a grip throttle in order
      to connect the general circuit. We are currently looking for a set of
      tires, a chain, and a sprocket for the motorcycle, however the group is
      currently thinking to manufacture a custom sprocket. The battery was
      disassembled in order to discharge the battery cells for safety reasons.
      The heating element was tested with motor connected in series with it. Did
      not heat up the heating element. However, connecting the heating element
      by itself to the batteries (2S-1P, 6.6V) heated it up very quickly. It was
      decided to connect cells 2S-24P for discharge. 6.6V was tested, and the
      calculations show that the pack will be discharged in 32 hours. 9 hours a
      day, for three and a half days.

      Today we welcomed Edgar Hernandez, Adrian Ortega, Erin Brett and Ben
      Wenberg to the project. The new group members were introduced to the
      motorcycle and we discussed the plans for the summer as a group. We took
      the initiative to clean up the motorcycle a bit and cleaned the rust off
      the breaks, checked inside the pistons for water damage, and put the
      suspension back in. Because each one of our schedules differ, we have
      decided that two - three people will be working together on a specific
      task in order to increase the amount of work being done to complete the
      project. Fortunately, the size of our group has doubled since last
      semester and we are expecting more progress to be done on the project
      throughout the summer.
