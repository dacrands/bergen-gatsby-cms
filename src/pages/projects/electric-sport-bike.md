      Today we welcomed Edgar Hernandez, Adrian Ortega, Erin Brett and Ben
      Wenberg to the project. The new group members were introduced to the
      motorcycle and we discussed the plans for the summer as a group. We took
      the initiative to clean up the motorcycle a bit and cleaned the rust off
      the breaks, checked inside the pistons for water damage, and put the
      suspension back in. Because each one of our schedules differ, we have
      decided that two - three people will be working together on a specific
      task in order to increase the amount of work being done to complete the
      project. Fortunately, the size of our group has doubled since last
      semester and we are expecting more progress to be done on the project
      throughout the summer.
