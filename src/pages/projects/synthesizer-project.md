  Teena began as a question of how a piece of music technology could combine
  portability, ease of use, and customization lacking from synthesizers in the
  market. Key to the planning process was a focus on intuitive expression and
  the expansion of the possibilities of synthesis.


  To be specific, Teena offers an x-y coordinate of parameters that match to
  whatever the user wishes, so someone could activate a reverb and flanger while
  playing a melody. The effects are adjusted through a joystick extending in
  every direction for a variety of manipulations of audio signals.


  As Teena is a groovebox, it can be used in conjunction with any software you
  may desire- it is optimized for modularity and easily integrated into modern
  digital audio workstations like Ableton Live or FL Studio.


  Electronic musicians tend to compose in one of two ways:

  They use Digital Audio Workstation software (DAW) to sequence samples or
  synthesize sounds on a desktop computer or laptop

  They use dedicated hardware to produce their music


  Both methods have drawbacks.

  Creating music with a computer is inexpressive and non-tactile. This can make
  it difficult for artists to include a human-sounding element in their music.

  Expressive hardware synthesizers, mixers, and sequencers are bulky. They
  cannot be easily transported or used on-the-go


  Few options exist for mobile music production. Those that do are limited in
  feature set or prohibitively expensive.

  TEENA is a compact digital instrument. It has been developed to provide a
  relatively cheap, extendable, and expressive dedicated-hardware solution to
  making music in a compact form-factor.
