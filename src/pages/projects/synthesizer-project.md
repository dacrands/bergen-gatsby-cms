title: 'TEENA: An Open Platform for Musical Production and Live Performance'

abstract: >+

  Teena began as a question of how a piece of music technology could combine
  portability, ease of use, and customization lacking from synthesizers in the
  market. Key to the planning process was a focus on intuitive expression and
  the expansion of the possibilities of synthesis.


  To be specific, Teena offers an x-y coordinate of parameters that match to
  whatever the user wishes, so someone could activate a reverb and flanger while
  playing a melody. The effects are adjusted through a joystick extending in
  every direction for a variety of manipulations of audio signals.


  As Teena is a groovebox, it can be used in conjunction with any software you
  may desire- it is optimized for modularity and easily integrated into modern
  digital audio workstations like Ableton Live or FL Studio.


  Electronic musicians tend to compose in one of two ways:

  They use Digital Audio Workstation software (DAW) to sequence samples or
  synthesize sounds on a desktop computer or laptop

  They use dedicated hardware to produce their music


  Both methods have drawbacks.

  Creating music with a computer is inexpressive and non-tactile. This can make
  it difficult for artists to include a human-sounding element in their music.

  Expressive hardware synthesizers, mixers, and sequencers are bulky. They
  cannot be easily transported or used on-the-go


  Few options exist for mobile music production. Those that do are limited in
  feature set or prohibitively expensive.

  TEENA is a compact digital instrument. It has been developed to provide a
  relatively cheap, extendable, and expressive dedicated-hardware solution to
  making music in a compact form-factor.

      Work has begun on the 2-axis parameter slider. The beginning of a key
      retention mechanism is in development. Keys have been extended and
      modified to suit this change while keeping the exposed key size the same.
      Work has begun on interface design.

      Spent most of the workday preparing for presentations. The faceplate for
      TEENA is coming along well. Hoping to have a render in time for the
      presentation.


      Marked regions indicate the size of the circuit board and 3D printer built
      plate. Each piece will fit on a standard 3D printer plate.

      Having received parts, our initial focus has been on the construction of
      the deviceâ€™s keybed. Cherry MX linear-action computer key-switches were
      used for their consistent responsiveness and lack of click. Potential
      layouts and methods of actuation were reviewed.

      Mounting solutions were explored and printing continued on key prototypes.
      Keys were connected for easier mounting and printing

      Vertical spacing between keys was found to be inadequate. Revision adds
      additional tolerance as well as chamfers for clearance. Layout sketch was
      completed and decal included to suit the project name.

      Did some work over the weekend to add the second octave and implement
      design changes discussed at the end of last week. Key support was raised
      slightly and changed from single round pins to slots. Keybed sections slot
      together with dovetail joints.
