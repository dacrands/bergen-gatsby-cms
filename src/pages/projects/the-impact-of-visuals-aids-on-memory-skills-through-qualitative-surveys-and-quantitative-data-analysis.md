  Biofeedback instruments help understand the physiological responses to stimuli
  of the autonomic nervous system. The EEG (Electroencephalography) will be used
  to measure the participants’ brain waves while showing them videos stimulating
  fear, happiness, sadness. During the sessions, brain activity with the
  specific frequencies will be recorded. After each video is played, questions
  will be asked to address the focus on the emotional arousal/memory recall
  process. In addition to that, EKG (Electrocardiography) will record the heart
  rates and the GSR monitor (Galvanic Skin Response) will measure the sweat
  gland activity related to the emotional response. The quantitative data such
  as EEG, EKG and GSR, surveys before and after the trainings will represent the
  qualitative data.

      Hopefully, we finish choosing our videos today. We discussed the methods
      again because we STILL do not have the materials we need to test the
      instruments. So far, we choose:


      * **Comedy**


      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Un6KQLk64Oo (Japanese game show)


      * **Horror**


      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDn0og5Vldg (lights out) 


      * _Still no update on our purchase order._ 

      * _Still no update on brainmaster renewal._ 


      We will be working on our post-questionnaire. There will be two separate
      questionnaires for comedy and horror. 


      We need to organize our literature review, so we made a Lit Review
      Spreadsheet. We separated the EEG and ECG sources because so far we have
      not found any journals that use both instruments. 


      Post questionnaires for both videos are complete. We just need to
      proofread both sets of questions and see which ones would work.


      ![](/img/screen-shot-2019-08-22-at-2.32.48-pm.png)


      * **Crash course on Memory**


      https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=547&v=bSycdIx-C48 


      **Most important information:**


      * **Making memory Process:**


      ![](/img/screen-shot-2019-08-22-at-2.34.51-pm.png)


      * **Recall memory:** 


      **\_\_\_\__** is the capital city of Greece


      * **Recognition memory:**


      What is the capital city of Greece?


      a) Athens


      b) Rome


      * **Relearning**


      Example, reviewing materials studied during the year for the final exam.


      **A study studying brain behavior from EEG scans in Learning and Memory
      Recall**


      https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-02913-9_174 


      The study provides brain mapping of the regions and the brain waves
      involved in the process of learning.


      Also, it provides additional info on successful memory recall!


      * The process of Memory Formation: Theory of 2 sociologists (R. Atkinson
      and R. Shiffrin)


      ![](/img/screen-shot-2019-08-22-at-2.37.32-pm.png)


      We are working on the IRB document. We are still proofreading the
      questionnaires. We can watch the videos and test the questions ourselves.


      We need to figure out what the raspberry pi is/how it works. (For holding
      our data/security)


      Most of the IRB is complete for 2019-2020, we need to finish the
      Application and Attachment 1 (request for purchase order?).


      We still have no update on our personal purchase order.

  - body: "Today we worked on the pre survey and a little bit of the post survey. The post survey can not be completed until we figure out which video clips will be shown. \n\n**_Brainstorm ideas for the experiment process:_**\n\n1. Watch three videos then give the test\n2. Watch two videos then give the test\n3. Give test after each video\n4. Take pre-survey, divide the groups depending on which films they watch the most (one film each)\n\nIf we show the participants three different videos each, but the second and the third video will be affected because they will know that we are giving them a memory test. To prevent that, we should give each participant to watch only one video, randomly selecting any three of the videos. In that case, we need a lot of participants and that’s unlikely. The only way we can solve this problem is by testing the EEG, EKG, and GSR, but we do not have enough materials to continue.\n\n**_Methods_**\n\n1. Pre Survey: generic questions\n2.

    title: Week 2
    image: /img/bergen-stem-graphic.jpg
  - body: >-
      We started the day by bouncing ideas around with each other as well as
      attempting to create     the pre-questionnaire. We are still trying to
      figure out the final draft of our research. We also found out the
      brainmaster program expired and needs to be renewed. Towards the end of
      the session, Dr. DiLauro showed us how the EKG works through BioPac and
      the Alienware laptop. Although we didn’t get the accurate data due to
      shortage in equipment, it was still interesting to see the process.


      Today we started the purchase order request form. Also, we started looking
      into why the brain reacts with fear while something scares us.
      _**(https://www.businessinsider.com/what-happen
      s-when-you-are-scared-2015-10**_). The link explains clearly what part of
      the brain are affected, and how that helped the human population years
      ago, and how that effect has evolved. 


      * **Ideas:** 


      1. Social media, videos (horror, comedy, sad) How watching different
      genres of videos could affect the mood of a person. 

      2. How emotions triggered by different genres of movies affect our
      internal body (brain waves, heartbeat, perspiration) 


      * **For BioPac:** 


      Lesson 7 (testing) and 9 (table)


      * **Biofeedback instruments:**

      https://online-infobase-com.ezproxy.bergen.edu/HRC/Search/Details/11?articleId=104832&q=stress%20and%20brain%20waves


      * **Brain anatomy:**


      1.

      * **Brain waves:**

      2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5LT9b-L9_Y


      * **Brain waves control Memories:**


      1.
      https://news.mit.edu/2018/new-study-reveals-how-brain-waves-control-working-memory-0126


      * **How can scary movies identify the brain circuits for the process of
      fear:**


      1.
      http://www.ucihealth.org/news/2017/02/scary-movies-assist-brain-research


      * **Next Step:**


      Research on actual papers on the effects of horrors/comic movies


      * **New/final topic:**


      1. Exploring the Internal World By Stimulating the Brain Memory With
      Visual Aides.

      2. Examination of Memory By Stimulating the Brain and Body Through Certain
      Visual Aides.


      We used the whiteboard to organize our experiment. We thought of different
      variables that could affect the experiment. We spent a few minutes
      watching different possible videos we could use for the experiment. (E.g.
      Up, Minions, Nightmare on Elm Street, The Ring, The Grudge)


      We tested the virtual reality equipment:


      * **Pros:** the outside environment can be blocked out, better horror
      reality, theatre like vision

      * **Cons:** possibly not working with other equipment, light being an
      issue.


      **_Ideas:_**


      1. Have the participants go through a quick memorization test, then show
      them the video, right afterwards give them another quick memorization test
      (similar but not exactly the same).

      2. Pre survey directing what kind of video will be shown?

      3. Open room vs. Closed room

      4. Virtual reality

      5. Memories play a role in recalling memories:

      **\[Experimental Design]** The project in separated into four parts as
      shown above. (Left to right) First box is the consent form and the number
      that has to be assigned to the participants. Second box is the pre-survey:
      the questions we’re going to ask before the experiment in conducted (in
      this step we will eliminate important obstacles in our study). The third
      box is the main experiment; the ideas and models are written on the
      board/journals. The fourth box is the post-survey: the questions after the
      experiment. We will need to test the equipment before we can move on to
      the next stage of our project.

      **IRB update: Attachment 3, 4 and 5 revised and updated.** 


      1. We need to ask the professor about the Raspberry Pi and the purchase
      order for biopac. 

      2. We also need the professor to look over the IRB to check what else we
      need to fix. 


      **How emotions can affect memory.**


      Still waiting on the supplies to come.


      **Development of emotion recognition interface using complex EEG/ECG
      bio-signal for interactive contents**


      1. Subject of the article

      2. Accuracy;

      3. Electroencephalography;

      4. Emotions;

      5. Recognition;

      6. Interactive systems


      _**https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.bergen.edu/docview/1899614234/1AF3757220F44079PQ/7?accountid=8580**_


      1. This article uses videos as well to induce certain emotions such as
      fear, sadness, disgust, joy, and anger.

      2. Their experiment consisted of 30 seconds of rest followed by 90 seconds
      of emotion induced videos. 

      3. They used a dark room where the participants were isolated and so they
      were able to completely focus on the videos being played, with videos
      playing and stopping every 90 seconds. 

      4. They also shuffled around the videos so all the participants were not
      watching the same videos.

      5. How did they get accuracy percentages? (Weka) (It was found that the
      EEG signal alone had an accuracy of up to 69.78% and a mean accuracy of
      62.28%. However, when adding the complex bio-signal from the autonomic
      nervous system, the accuracy reached 99.32%, with a mean accuracy of
      98.56%.)  We can add that using both the brainmaster and biopac can make
      our findings even more accurate. (reason of why we should use both
      brainmaster and biopac)


      **A preliminary investigation into the neural basis of the production
      effect**

      https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.bergen.edu/docview/1792775466/F51D86DAE25E46E8PQ/10?accountid=8580


      1. We finished updating the entire IRB. 

      2. How visual aides that induce certain emotions could help us remember
      certain ads. 

      3. IRB was reviewed by our mentor.

      4. We finished getting all IRB documents signed in one day.

      5. We spent the afternoon meeting the dean, vice president, and the
      president of the grants department of BCC.


      **Our focus is now on writing the introduction of the research paper.** 


      We got in contact with Brainmaster by phone, unfortunately the purchase
      order we requested did not go through due to some issues from Brainmaster.
      They are now aware of our situation and are currently working towards
      giving us access to the program. 


      No update on our purchase order forms.
