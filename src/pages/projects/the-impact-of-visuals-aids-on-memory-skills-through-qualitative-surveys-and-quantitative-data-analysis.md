  Biofeedback instruments help understand the physiological responses to stimuli
  of the autonomic nervous system. The EEG (Electroencephalography) will be used
  to measure the participants’ brain waves while showing them videos stimulating
  fear, happiness, sadness. During the sessions, brain activity with the
  specific frequencies will be recorded. After each video is played, questions
  will be asked to address the focus on the emotional arousal/memory recall
  process. In addition to that, EKG (Electrocardiography) will record the heart
  rates and the GSR monitor (Galvanic Skin Response) will measure the sweat
  gland activity related to the emotional response. The quantitative data such
  as EEG, EKG and GSR, surveys before and after the trainings will represent the
  qualitative data.

      We started the day by bouncing ideas around with each other as well as
      attempting to create     the pre-questionnaire. We are still trying to
      figure out the final draft of our research. We also found out the
      brainmaster program expired and needs to be renewed. Towards the end of
      the session, Dr. DiLauro showed us how the EKG works through BioPac and
      the Alienware laptop. Although we didn’t get the accurate data due to
      shortage in equipment, it was still interesting to see the process.


      Today we started the purchase order request form. Also, we started looking
      into why the brain reacts with fear while something scares us.
      _**(https://www.businessinsider.com/what-happen
      s-when-you-are-scared-2015-10**_). The link explains clearly what part of
      the brain are affected, and how that helped the human population years
      ago, and how that effect has evolved. 


      * **Ideas:** 


      1. Social media, videos (horror, comedy, sad) How watching different
      genres of videos could affect the mood of a person. 

      2. How emotions triggered by different genres of movies affect our
      internal body (brain waves, heartbeat, perspiration) 


      * **For BioPac:** 


      Lesson 7 (testing) and 9 (table)

      * **How can scary movies identify the brain circuits for the process of
      fear:**


      1.
      http://www.ucihealth.org/news/2017/02/scary-movies-assist-brain-research


      * **Next Step:**


      Research on actual papers on the effects of horrors/comic movies


      * **New/final topic:**


      1. Exploring the Internal World By Stimulating the Brain Memory With
      Visual Aides.

      2. Examination of Memory By Stimulating the Brain and Body Through Certain
      Visual Aides.


      We used the whiteboard to organize our experiment. We thought of different
      variables that could affect the experiment. We spent a few minutes
      watching different possible videos we could use for the experiment. (E.g.
      Up, Minions, Nightmare on Elm Street, The Ring, The Grudge)


      We tested the virtual reality equipment:


      * **Pros:** the outside environment can be blocked out, better horror
      reality, theatre like vision

      * **Cons:** possibly not working with other equipment, light being an
      issue.


      **_Ideas:_**


      1. Have the participants go through a quick memorization test, then show
      them the video, right afterwards give them another quick memorization test
      (similar but not exactly the same).

      2. Pre survey directing what kind of video will be shown?

      3. Open room vs. Closed room

      4. Virtual reality

      5. Memories play a role in recalling memories:

      **\[Experimental Design]** The project in separated into four parts as
      shown above. (Left to right) First box is the consent form and the number
      that has to be assigned to the participants. Second box is the pre-survey:
      the questions we’re going to ask before the experiment in conducted (in
      this step we will eliminate important obstacles in our study). The third
      box is the main experiment; the ideas and models are written on the
      board/journals. The fourth box is the post-survey: the questions after the
      experiment. We will need to test the equipment before we can move on to
      the next stage of our project.
