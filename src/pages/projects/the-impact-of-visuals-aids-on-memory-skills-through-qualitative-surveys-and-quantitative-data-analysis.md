  The Impact of Visuals Aids on Memory Skills through Qualitative Surveys and
  Quantitative Data Analysis

abstract: >-
  Biofeedback instruments help understand the physiological responses to stimuli
  of the autonomic nervous system. The EEG (Electroencephalography) will be used
  to measure the participants’ brain waves while showing them videos stimulating
  fear, happiness, sadness. During the sessions, brain activity with the
  specific frequencies will be recorded. After each video is played, questions
  will be asked to address the focus on the emotional arousal/memory recall
  process. In addition to that, EKG (Electrocardiography) will record the heart
  rates and the GSR monitor (Galvanic Skin Response) will measure the sweat
  gland activity related to the emotional response. The quantitative data such
  as EEG, EKG and GSR, surveys before and after the trainings will represent the
  qualitative data.

      We started the day by bouncing ideas around with each other as well as
      attempting to create     the pre-questionnaire. We are still trying to
      figure out the final draft of our research. We also found out the
      brainmaster program expired and needs to be renewed. Towards the end of
      the session, Dr. DiLauro showed us how the EKG works through BioPac and
      the Alienware laptop. Although we didn’t get the accurate data due to
      shortage in equipment, it was still interesting to see the process.
