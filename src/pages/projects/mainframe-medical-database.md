title: Mainframe Medical Database

abstract: >-
  The purpose of this project is to create a medical database within a mainframe
  environment. In order to accomplish this task, we will be gathering readily
  available data from government regulated websites. This data must be in the
  form of a .CSV file, and will be transferred to a mainframe environment
  through FTP. Meanwhile, we will simultaneously be creating a logical model of
  our database using ERwin Data Modeling software.  From here we will use DDL to
  create a DB2 mainframe database to store our acquired data. Finally, we will
  use SQL queries to analyze this database to look for interesting trends,
  patterns, and statistics, and ultimately use FTP to bring those results out of
  the mainframe environment into a user-friendly “front-end” software.
