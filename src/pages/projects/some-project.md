To investigate the microbial community in our compost, compare them to the microbes in the soil, and hypothesize as to why these differences are based on their characteristics.

## Research

Microbiological reference information collected through library resources.

## Conclusion

_The Rocket_ composting system is capable of producing healthy soil and can be used by the community for agriculture purposes.
