  Social Hierarchy in Eastern Gray Squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis): Feeding
  behavior of dominant and subordinate squirrels in same area
image: /img/carolinensis.jpg
abstract: >-
  To further examine the social dominance in eastern gray squirrels in regard to
  the feeding behavior of dominant and subordinate squirrels. In this research,
  the dominant squirrel will be defined as the squirrel that successfully takes
  the nut and eats it. The subordinate squirrel will be defined as the squirrel
  that was unable to acquire and eat the nut. The reactions of the dominant and
  subordinate squirrels when given a nut in the presence of each other will be
  recorded on a digital camera/GoPro (whichever is accessible) and analyzed. The
  main objective is to observe whether the subordinate squirrel submissively
  gives up the nut to the dominant squirrel.

  - body: "My research project with Dr. Charles Sontag is to study the social hierarchy of Eastern Gray Squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis). It has been proven throughout various studies done in the past that gray squirrels have a social dominance system based on sex; Where males are dominant over females, and age; Where older squirrels are dominant over younger squirrels. We aimed to specifically analyze dominance by observing the feeding behaviors of dominant squirrels and subordinate squirrels in the same area in the presence of a human. Past studies analyzed social dominance in gray squirrels using food, but they were provided food on trays or other tools and spent hours upon hours to see how they naturally fight for food. I considered this flawed because it is unknown whether the squirrels would have displayed different behavior had the food been placed between them at the same time. \r\n\nSince this was an entirely new project, I was tasked with doing a literature review to analyze previous studies that either solely focused on gray squirrel social dominance or studies that studied the behavior and phenotypes of squirrels in general. Other studies, as I mentioned before, did use food to study dominance in gray squirrels, but their methods did not satisfy my questions about gray squirrel dominance due to a lack to essentially any control over the environment. While their results are invaluable and deserve credit, my research would provide a different perspective as it shows the behavior of gray squirrels in a more controlled environment."
