  Social Hierarchy in Eastern Gray Squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis): Feeding
  behavior of dominant and subordinate squirrels in same area
image: /img/carolinensis.jpg
abstract: >-
  To further examine the social dominance in eastern gray squirrels in regard to
  the feeding behavior of dominant and subordinate squirrels. In this research,
  the dominant squirrel will be defined as the squirrel that successfully takes
  the nut and eats it. The subordinate squirrel will be defined as the squirrel
  that was unable to acquire and eat the nut. The reactions of the dominant and
  subordinate squirrels when given a nut in the presence of each other will be
  recorded on a digital camera/GoPro (whichever is accessible) and analyzed. The
  main objective is to observe whether the subordinate squirrel submissively
  gives up the nut to the dominant squirrel.
