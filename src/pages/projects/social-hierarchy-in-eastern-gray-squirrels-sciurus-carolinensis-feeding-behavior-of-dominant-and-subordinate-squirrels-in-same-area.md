title: Social Hierarchy in Eastern Grey Squirrels (Sciurus Carolinensis)
image: /img/carolinensis.jpg
abstract: >-
  To further examine the social dominance in eastern gray squirrels in regard to
  the feeding behavior of dominant and subordinate squirrels. In this research,
  the dominant squirrel will be defined as the squirrel that successfully takes
  the nut and eats it. The subordinate squirrel will be defined as the squirrel
  that was unable to acquire and eat the nut. The reactions of the dominant and
  subordinate squirrels when given a nut in the presence of each other will be
  recorded on a digital camera/GoPro (whichever is accessible) and analyzed. The
  main objective is to observe whether the subordinate squirrel submissively
  gives up the nut to the dominant squirrel.

      This past week unfortunately did not yield any progress in this research.
      Due to the heat wave and excessive rain there was little to no S.
      Carolinensis activity in any of the locations being observed. However,
      food was still left out to maintain the integrity of the research and keep
      the S. Carolinensis in the area coming back to the sites of food. On days
      after leaving food, I went back to the food sites to see that the piles of
      peanuts were gone. This tells me that the gray squirrels (and most likely
      other animals) in the area are still foraging for food. My prediction is
      that they waited and went out for food in better weather conditions.
      Either earlier in the morning/late evening when it may have been cooler in
      temperature and when the rain wasn’t heavily falling. 


      Unfortunately, the Bushnell Trophy Cam HD was not able to be put up this
      week but will be mounted and set to record footage in the next week (Week
      4). With the ability to obtain actual footage the goal is to see if there
      are multiple squirrels grabbing food from the same pile or if there is
      only one squirrel going back each time. This will hopefully show signs of
      dominance in that there is only one squirrel grabbing food while others
      wait around. If there are multiple S. Carolinensis grabbing food from the
      same pile this will be interesting as well. More information will be
      gathered in the coming week.

      This week I have continued to visit the locations previously mentioned for
      observation with the goal to build the squirrels’ trust. At the Van Saun
      park location all the piles of food left were entirely consumed other than
      a few pumpkin seeds. I had decided to leave only peanuts from this point
      on as this study is based on social dominance and not food preference.
      However, the S. Carolinensis in all locations seem to be more inclined to
      gather the peanuts. Three piles of peanuts were put out in the morning of
      Tuesday 7/9 and two squirrels were spotted at the Van Saun location but,
      only one captured on camera (pictures attached). I stayed nearby and
      observed how they both watched me. One squirrel was on the ground foraging
      for food while looking up periodically to see where I stood. The other
      squirrel which I noticed to be a bit larger stayed on the tree with
      his/her eyes on me the whole time. The smaller S. Carolinensis didn’t seem
      to mind my presence so long as I didn’t make any sudden movements. I have
      not been able to determine the sex of these S. Carolinensis just yet.  


      On the same day at the BCC campus location I filled the bird feeder at
      approximately 1PM and two squirrels were spotted about ten feet away
      (picture attached). They’re behavior was similar to that of the squirrels
      at Van Saun Park. One was on the ground looking around while the other was
      in a nearby tree watching. I find this behavior to be quite interesting as
      it may be a sign of dominance. I went back to this area about 2 hours
      later to find the bird feeder empty and now five S. Carolinensis were in
      the area. 


      At Van Saun park the next day, I observed that all piles of food left had
      been consumed or stored. Three more piles of food were put out and no
      squirrels had been spotted at the time. A couple hours later I went to
      look at the piles of food. Location 1 had less food in the pile, location
      2 did have any peanuts left, and location 3 was untouched. Three squirrels
      were in the vicinity. Two of them were watching from a tree, and one was
      carrying a few peanuts. I had laid a few more peanuts down and then walked
      away. That afternoon at the BCC campus location, I filled up the bird
      feeder with the prediction that it would be empty later the same day.
      Three S. Carolinensis were in the vicinity watching as I left food for
      them. 


      It’s to be believed that the squirrels in these areas are beginning to
      associate my presence with receiving food. In the next coming week, a
      Bushnell Trophy Cam HD will be put up at the BCC location to monitor how
      fast the squirrels in the area are taking the peanuts from the bird
      feeder. I will also be spending more time in the field observing the S.
      Carolinensis’ with Bushnell 10x50 PowerView binoculars for an extended
      period of time from apporximately 50-100 meters away.

      My name is Chloe Raven Ennis. I have taken over this project with Dr.
      Sontag from Jung Yoon. I am still monitoring the location on the Bergen
      Community College campus. This area is located down by Ender Hall and the
      Challenger Center. However, I will not be continuing to monitor the Leonia
      location. The other locations I have decided to observe is outside my own
      home in Glen Rock, NJ and an area off of parking lot 6 at Van Saun County
      Park in Paramus, NJ. I will be feeding the squirrels that I come in
      contact with, roasted/unsalted peanuts and roasted/salted pumpkin seeds. 

       On Wednesday July 3rd, 2019 I had visited Van Saun and laid down 3 piles of food in 3 different areas of the location. Two piles of peanuts and one pile of pumpkin seeds (pictures attached). I waited around for a little while in hopes that any S. Carolinensis in the area will notice my presence and realize I am not a threat once I had left the area and left them food. The same procedure was followed outside my home in Glen Rock, NJ. One S. Carolinensis was spotted in a tree above the area I had laid out food. This gray squirrel watched me with caution but did not run away. I left after a few minutes to show the squirrel that he/she could trust me. The sex of this S. Carolinensis could not be determined at the time. 

      My goals in continuing this project are to gain the trust of at least 2 or
      more squirrels in these chosen locations. Once their trust is gained, I
      will begin observing their eating habits as well as looking for the
      determining factors in which squirrels are dominant and which are
      subordinate. What I will be looking for in these determining factors is
      the sex of the squirrels being observed and if possible, the approximate
      age. For any questions regarding my research thus far, please contact me
      at cennis@me.bergen.edu. Thank you.

      This week I started to start sunflower seed trust exercises in Leonia on
      Tuesday mornings and Wednesdays. On Mondays, Tuesday afternoons, and on
      Thursdays, I am on the Bergen campus feeding the squirrels at
      approximately 11:30 AM and 1:40 PM and continuing to prepare my research
      article after I finish placing the sunflower seeds at the designated place
      each time. I noticed that the squirrels in Leonia are starting to eat the
      sunflowers because all the seeds I have placed have been eaten. This is
      good because if all goes well, Leonia will be an exceptional experimenting
      site since there is a large population of S. carolinensis.  


      I am hoping that the squirrels make a habit of visiting the location at a
      certain time every day to make it possible for me to begin conducting
      experiments. It is a priority for to hopefully start recording next week
      and begin collecting data. I have started preparing my
      introduction/literature review. If anyone would like to help conduct
      experiments please reach out to me so we can discuss the best course of
      action!

      This week I decided that it would be best to move the sunflower seeds to
      one location rather than two locations in the same vicinity to more
      efficiently utilize the sunflower seeds. I have yet to be successful in
      making the squirrels comfortable around with me to congregate around me
      but I am seeing success in regard to them frequently eating the food that
      I place for them. The branch in which the bird feeder was attached to
      actually broke so what this tells me is that there was probably more than
      one squirrel that was on the feeder and the weight caused the branch to
      break. 


      While this is terrible news for the branch, it is good news for me because
      it tells me that the food is being eaten by squirrels and not chipmunks
      because 


      1.  chipmunks are substantially lighter than squirrels and thus would
      require a significant amount of chipmunks on the same branch which is
      unlikely

      2. chipmunks are not social foragers and thus are more independent and
      isolated than squirrels so it is unlikely a large number of chipmunks
      caused the branch to snap. I will continue placing sunflower seeds as I
      cannot force the squirrels to cooperate with me and it will take a lot of
      patience and time (hopefully they will start trusting me soon!). The
      highlight of my week was spotting a very young squirrel.

  - body: "At the end of this week I was able to nearly complete my literature review. I organized my data in a spreadsheet and was able to find a major gap in the literature, which was that all the studies that I have found that were focused on the social hierarchy of S. carolinensis had similar methodologies that did not consist of direct contact (By direct contact I mean humans handing food to two or more squirrels) between humans and squirrels besides trapping, tagging, or marking them. The major difference in methodology between my research and previously finished studies makes my study capable of being published. Now some people may wonder, “How can results found from studying wildlife in controlled settings be considered valid?”. That is a strong argument, however, it can be said that all the previous studies, whether it was clear and obvious or discreet, had different levels of controlled environments (The tray of food itself is a controlled factor!). That would disqualify all past studies and the fact of the matter is my research just has a more obvious and clearly stated controlled environment compared to other studies. \r\n\nWith the gap having been established, I went ahead to place sunflower seeds in a chosen location (Challenger Center on the Bergen Campus-picture is attached) and also placed a bird feeder full of sunflower seeds in the same area. I did this to get the trust of squirrels to make it possible for me to do the research experiments. I have not been successful so far in getting them to trust me but I have noticed that the squirrels are using the bird feeder substantially more than the first time I placed it there. It is my hope that by next week I am able to conduct the research with the squirrels."

  - body: "My research project with Dr. Charles Sontag is to study the social hierarchy of Eastern Gray Squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis). It has been proven throughout various studies done in the past that gray squirrels have a social dominance system based on sex; Where males are dominant over females, and age; Where older squirrels are dominant over younger squirrels. We aimed to specifically analyze dominance by observing the feeding behaviors of dominant squirrels and subordinate squirrels in the same area in the presence of a human. Past studies analyzed social dominance in gray squirrels using food, but they were provided food on trays or other tools and spent hours upon hours to see how they naturally fight for food. I considered this flawed because it is unknown whether the squirrels would have displayed different behavior had the food been placed between them at the same time. \r\n\nSince this was an entirely new project, I was tasked with doing a literature review to analyze previous studies that either solely focused on gray squirrel social dominance or studies that studied the behavior and phenotypes of squirrels in general. Other studies, as I mentioned before, did use food to study dominance in gray squirrels, but their methods did not satisfy my questions about gray squirrel dominance due to a lack to essentially any control over the environment. While their results are invaluable and deserve credit, my research would provide a different perspective as it shows the behavior of gray squirrels in a more controlled environment."
