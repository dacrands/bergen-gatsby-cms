  Social Hierarchy in Eastern Gray Squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis): Feeding
  behavior of dominant and subordinate squirrels in same area
image: /img/carolinensis.jpg
abstract: >-
  To further examine the social dominance in eastern gray squirrels in regard to
  the feeding behavior of dominant and subordinate squirrels. In this research,
  the dominant squirrel will be defined as the squirrel that successfully takes
  the nut and eats it. The subordinate squirrel will be defined as the squirrel
  that was unable to acquire and eat the nut. The reactions of the dominant and
  subordinate squirrels when given a nut in the presence of each other will be
  recorded on a digital camera/GoPro (whichever is accessible) and analyzed. The
  main objective is to observe whether the subordinate squirrel submissively
  gives up the nut to the dominant squirrel.

  - body: "My research project with Dr. Charles Sontag is to study the social hierarchy of Eastern Gray Squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis). It has been proven throughout various studies done in the past that gray squirrels have a social dominance system based on sex; Where males are dominant over females, and age; Where older squirrels are dominant over younger squirrels. We aimed to specifically analyze dominance by observing the feeding behaviors of dominant squirrels and subordinate squirrels in the same area in the presence of a human. Past studies analyzed social dominance in gray squirrels using food, but they were provided food on trays or other tools and spent hours upon hours to see how they naturally fight for food. I considered this flawed because it is unknown whether the squirrels would have displayed different behavior had the food been placed between them at the same time. \r\n\nSince this was an entirely new project, I was tasked with doing a literature review to analyze previous studies that either solely focused on gray squirrel social dominance or studies that studied the behavior and phenotypes of squirrels in general. Other studies, as I mentioned before, did use food to study dominance in gray squirrels, but their methods did not satisfy my questions about gray squirrel dominance due to a lack to essentially any control over the environment. While their results are invaluable and deserve credit, my research would provide a different perspective as it shows the behavior of gray squirrels in a more controlled environment."

  - body: "At the end of this week I was able to nearly complete my literature review. I organized my data in a spreadsheet and was able to find a major gap in the literature, which was that all the studies that I have found that were focused on the social hierarchy of S. carolinensis had similar methodologies that did not consist of direct contact (By direct contact I mean humans handing food to two or more squirrels) between humans and squirrels besides trapping, tagging, or marking them. The major difference in methodology between my research and previously finished studies makes my study capable of being published. Now some people may wonder, “How can results found from studying wildlife in controlled settings be considered valid?”. That is a strong argument, however, it can be said that all the previous studies, whether it was clear and obvious or discreet, had different levels of controlled environments (The tray of food itself is a controlled factor!). That would disqualify all past studies and the fact of the matter is my research just has a more obvious and clearly stated controlled environment compared to other studies. \r\n\nWith the gap having been established, I went ahead to place sunflower seeds in a chosen location (Challenger Center on the Bergen Campus-picture is attached) and also placed a bird feeder full of sunflower seeds in the same area. I did this to get the trust of squirrels to make it possible for me to do the research experiments. I have not been successful so far in getting them to trust me but I have noticed that the squirrels are using the bird feeder substantially more than the first time I placed it there. It is my hope that by next week I am able to conduct the research with the squirrels."
