The video is coming a long; we have to edit some photos before they are ready to be used.  \r\n\nWe continued to work on our STEM presentation.  When we were done making our final touches we reviewed it over and submitted it.\r\n\nWe practiced presenting our project and put together a bullet sheet to make the presentation as smooth as possible.  Tomorrow we will be presenting our project in front of the STEM administration along with other interns. Wish us luck!"

      We did a quick check in at the center to check up on all the plants and
      then we left to work remotely for the day.  We discovered the center is
      going to be getting some roof repairs done in the next few weeks.  Some of
      the beds containing the ferns on the north end of the roof garden will
      have to be removed during repairs.  In that case we have to remove the
      ferns and any other plant material from those beds which we will be doing
      Wednesday.  


      We emptied the planters of all soil and plant material that will have to
      be removed for the repairs on the roof.  The planters will have to be
      broken down in order to start on the roof repairs.  After that we planted
      the ferns and ivy on the east side of the property in replace of the
      rhododendrons we pulled out the other day.  The ferns should do very well
      in their new locations.

      We contacted the people who have generously donated the ferns that are
      currently in the roof garden to enquire about the possibility of donating
      more plant material to the center.  Hopefully we are able to obtain some
      plants to use around the center.  We are excited to hear from them and to
      see what we can obtain for the center.  


      We pulled out 7 rhododendrons that have completely died on the East side
      of the site.  After being able to pull them out with too much ease, we
      quickly could see that the roots did not acclimate to the soil and that is
      the reason why they must have died.  Although easy to pull out it was
      still a lot of work and we also had help from another intern whom we were
      so grateful for.

      Today we discussed the projects assigned to us by Dean.  We also continued
      weeding the west street side of the property.

      A lot of weeding and raking was done on the east side of the property. 
      All trash and large branches were removed.  Before and after pictures
      provided.


      Today we cleaned and weeded out the beds in the roof garden.  The euonymus
      that has died has been removed from the beds.  The others that are still
      growing will continue to be maintained.  The beds are ready for new plant
      material. A proposal of suggested plant material along with budget will be
      soon presented.  Before and after pictures are provided of today’s clean
      up.  Another sweep of the East side of property was done.  Weeding along
      North and West side of property was started.

      We worked out the final details of the site analysis, budget plan, and
      potential plant material list to work with for when we meet with Dean, the
      director at JRC.  We will present all these documents to him tomorrow when
      he comes to visit the center.


      Hyemee and I meet with the director of the James Rose Center, Dean, and
      proposed our plan and budget for the roof garden.  It was wonderful to
      meet him and was satisfied with the current work we have completed so
      far.  Dean set us to the task of reworking our proposal while also adding
      some new projects for us to think about.  We will be meeting again with
      him in a few weeks to discuss our new proposal and the other projects he
      assigned to us.  We surveyed the property and noted any work that needs to
      be done and some rhododendrons that need to be removed that have died.

      Ivy we cut back and most saplings were pulled.  General clean up of the
      garden completed so is suitable for new tenants.  Pictures provided
      demonstrate work that has been done.


      Due to the rain, I am limited on the work around the property that can be
      completed.  However the main task for today was to refill the fountains
      after they had been drained and cleaned by Kevin and set up the pumps.  I
      researched about James Rose and his past projects while the ponds were
      filling.  


      We went up to a plant nursery called Metropolitan Farm up in Closter.  We
      wanted to browse potential plant material to implement in the roof
      garden.  It was also good to get an estimation of cost for a budget.  It
      is a beautiful nursery with a wide variety to choose from.  Highly
      recommend visiting for any of your garden needs

  - body: "For the first day, the assistant director Kevin showed us around the property.  He explained all about the James Rose Center and gave us a tour of the site.  We then discussed the 3 zones that we would have a particular focus on during our internship.  Each zone has it’s own and different tasks and goals to accomplish.\r\r\n\n* **Zone 1- North Garden**\r\n\nThe North Garden is the backyard of the guesthouse.  Ivy is overgrown and in need of cutting back.  Saplings and weeds need to be pulled and raking of area.  New tenants move in July 1st and we plan to coordinate with them to help reach their desired goals for their yard.  \r\n\n* **Zone 2- Roof Garden**\r\n\nThe Roof Garden gets limited sunlight due to all the trees on the property leaving the planting beds moist and with little to no light.  They want to have more plants on the rooftop garden so we have to find suitable plants for the given conditions.  The ferns on the North side are doing well but ivy and Solomon Seal are sparse.  On the South side euonymus was planted in some of the beds.  Few have not adjusted well to the conditions and died out while others seem to be slowly readjusting and making a comeback.\r\n\n* **Zone 3- East Side of Property**\r\n\nThe East side of the property is in need of cleanup.  It needs to be raked and weeded and large fallen branches and trash removed.  Possibly implement more ivy to provide more privacy to the property from the East side."
