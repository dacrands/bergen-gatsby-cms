  By shadowing in the Dental Hygiene Clinic, we hope to gain exposure and
  experience in our potential field of study. Although we are not going to
  school to become hygienists, it is important to have a background knowledge of
  what procedures and methods are used for examination in dental offices.
  Without hygienists, oral doctors would not be able to accurately asses
  patients and provide the best treatment plan. Hygienists are trained to
  analyze and diagnose potential oral issue and provide effective oral care as
  needed.

      We also shadowed Professor Hall who is a Registered Dental Hygienist,
      teaches the students, and works at the St. Joseph Regional Hospital
      emergency dental clinic. We observed sub/ supragingival evaluations (they
      use the probe with the mm marks). We learned the different classifications
      of jaw alignment. class l is aligned, class ll is when the maxilla
      protrudes over the mandible (overbite), and a class lll is when the
      mandible comes out further than the maxilla (underbite). We were told that
      x-rays need to have a clear space between maxilla and mandible in order to
      get a good reading. Usually we will see patient with that are class l
      typical are those who use braces before.

  - body: "We were able to see many other different patient conditions. Dr. Tumillo explained the differences between crowns and natural teeth. Porcelain crowns (like a cap) are fused to surgical steel. We saw a patient who had a crown where the occlusal surface was chipped revealing the metal, \r\n\n* Bridge- three teeth were bridged together, there was molar, a missing tooth in the middle filled with a porcelain crown, and the final tooth of the bridge\r\n* Patient had receding gums which was most likely caused by harsh brushing, the bone structure and the gum receded exposing a layer of tooth that is not normally exposed to the air causing the tooth to become yellowish\r\n* Learned about the centum. The centum is under the CEJ (Cementoenamel Junction) and when exposed to the air it will turn yellow. It is supposed to be protected from the environment by the gums but sometimes brushing too hard will cause that part of the tooth to be exposed. The CEJ is a faint line that occurs and can be felt with the Shepard’s hook."

  - body: "We were lucky enough to shadow two dentists who are also great educators. They take the time to explain what is going on inside the patient’s mouth to us. We were able to observe a variety of different cases. We witnessed: \r\n\n* PTs of various age groups had x-rays taken… an intricate process with very exact angles to get a flawless view of the mouth. The whole room needs to be covered in barriers to make sure all surfaces are sterile. Once the room is properly set up, the hygienist is able to take an x-ray of the certain spot the dentist wanted. \r\n* We learned what was a facial V (5). A Facial V classifies when the gum tissue on the facial side recedes. The recession can be caused by brushing too hard. The gums retract to protect themselves from any external harm. By time the teeth can become sensitive because the root starts to be exposes \r\n* We were able to see two smokers, one of pts had a crown. That same patient had irritation of their gum which the hygienist thought was a fistula. The x-rays revealed that there was an opening on the side of the root of the tooth which allowed bacteria to enter. The bacteria could have possibly caused an abscess. The roof of a smoker’s mouth will be red, raw, and have bright red capillaries exposed.\r\n* We saw patients that had bridges. The dentist was able to identify the bridge not only by the way the fake tooth reflects light, but also the inability to floss in between the connected teeth.\r\n* Tori/ torus- bone structure that is found on the roof of the mouth and under the tongue. Many patients had tori on the floor of their mouth. It is very normal to have these bony structures."

      Theresa was a patient in the clinic for a day! One of the students was not
      able to work on the patient that was originally scheduled. During
      preliminary examinations, the student determined that the patient had
      abnormally high blood pressure and would not be able to perform the
      scheduled exam. As a patient, it was interesting to examine the clinic
      being a patient. The dental hygiene students are very thorough with their
      examinations. Everything is recorded with precise detail. The must note
      any marking on the teeth, abnormalities, expected markings, distinctive
      facial features, and anything else that is noteworthy. My appointment took
      three hours and in that three hours I did not even get to the cleaning.
      The hygienist that worked on me took his time to evaluate all my teeth. I
      had a metal amalgam (filling), a lingual bar (a retainer behind my top and
      bottom teeth), and build up under my permanent retainer). I was told it is
      very hard to clean under that retainer and calculus easily builds up right
      where the saliva pools. Saliva contains minerals. Over time, those
      minerals will become hard and bind to the teeth. Hopefully on my next
      visit we can finish my cleaning and take some x-rays!

      Ms. Kenyon also runs a biological test to determine whether or not the
      autoclave contains any harmful levels of bacteria. There is a vile that is
      placed in the AMSCO Autoclave every month. It tests the bacterial levels
      within the autoclave. The bacteria is checked by using two vials, one test
      and one control. The vial starts as a blue/ gray color once activated. It
      is placed in the autoclave for one complete cycle. After the cycle is
      completed, the vial is removed for analysis. If the vial is the same blue/
      gray color then the Autoclave is safe to use and there are no harmful
      bacteria inside. However, if the vial turns yellow or anything slightly
      different than the blueish gray, the autoclave is not safe. Ms. Kenyon
      keeps a log of the vial test results which also records the date, time,
      and cycle temperature. Patient safety is the clinic’s first priority so it
      is extremely important to run this biological test to prevent exposure to
      harmful bacteria.

      Sterile tools and areas are top priority. For this part of the clinic, the
      Bowie Dick test is needed, is designed to monitor air removal and steam
      penetration of instruments to insure that the sterilizer machine reaches
      optimal temperatures. In order to properly sterilize the instruments, the
      machine goes up to 270 °F \[132 °C],273 °F \[135 °C]. It also records the
      test cycle information of the outside to verify the Bowie Dick test pack
      is in the space provided and secured. The test itself is a sheet of
      standard yellow when it is unprocessed. The test will change to a blue/
      purple color to indicate the machine has passed the test and functioning
      at the proper temperature and pressure. This sheet is located in the
      middle of the packed, there are possibilities of the test failing,
      everyday we check to ensure that the procedure is followed correctly.

      We become familiar with the x-ray rooms. When the students are taking
      their radiology course, they are able to practice taking x-rays on
      mannequins that came from a real human skull. Dxxtr, the real human skull,
      is from the heads of deceased people who donated their bodies to science
      postmortem.  There are two adult skulls and one child skull. All three
      heads have real teeth in them. Within these x-ray rooms, there are two
      different types of x-rays, the conventional one dimension x-ray and a 3-D
      panoramic x-ray to get a full shot of the skull. Students have the ability
      to perform digital film and regular film which all physical x-ray of the
      patient.

      The dental hygiene clinic is preparing for an audit this upcoming fall. In
      order to prepare for the audit, every single piece of property within the
      clinic must be accounted for. Most items that have a value larger than
      $500 will be audited. We were assigned to going through any Dental Hygiene
      room to record the items. We came familiar of the equipment that is
      present at a  regular clinic. We were able to look at polishing machines,
      become familiar with the parts of the patient’s chair, and look at models
      of the mouth with removable teeth.

  - body: "Jacqueline and I have the standout opportunity to shadow at the Dental Hygiene Clinic at Bergen Community College. We will be shadowing a variety of staff members within the clinic. Primarily, we will be working with Ms. Michele Kenyon who is a Registered Dental Hygienist in addition to being the clinic’s Technical Assistant. Not only will we be helping and observing Ms. Kenyon’s daily role, we will be able to shadow dentists and other hygienists. \r\n\nBergen’s dental hygiene clinic is open Monday- Thursday from 8:00 am to 12:00pm. The dental hygiene students are working on real patients that come to the clinic to get quality care at a discounted rate. From shadowing in the clinic, we have realized that these students and staff assure the highest quality of care for their patients. In the beginning of the session, the student must take the patient’s blood pressure, pulse, oxygen levels, and record all of their medical history. It is very unusual to have your blood pressure taken when going to your normal dentist. However, at the clinic the hygienists want to ensure that there are no underlying issues or stresses the patient is suffering before starting the exam. Each student examines one patient within four hour time period. In a dental practice, cleanings do not tend to exceed 15 minutes; however, the students are under observation from different doctors everyday. They are also assigned to demonstrate to their professors all the learning methods in those four hours."
