title: Investigation of Biochemical Properties of Curcumin
image: /img/screen-shot-2019-10-11-at-6.59.15-pm.png
abstract: >
  The project objective is to create two products using curcumin, a hand cream
  to help with inflammation caused by arthritis and a UVA/UVB blocking sunscreen
  using Zinc Oxide as a physical blocker and curcumin as a chemical blocker. 
  Curcumin is very similar in structure to many other organic chemical blockers
  that block UVB radiation. Our hypothesis is that the similar structure of
  curcumin will allow it to act as an effective chemical UVB blocker while
  simultaneously contributing antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties to
  the sunscreen.

      On June 25, 2019 A new method was done using a blank paper disc. We
      inserted the blank paper disc into the solution then inserted on the
      swapped TSA and left it for 24 hours. Unfortunately no inhibition of
      bacteria was shown.

      **Dichloromethane Extraction Process** 


      In order to isolate the curcumin from the turmeric powder, an extraction
      process was used where Methylene Chloride was the solvent and the turmeric
      powder was the solute.


      Post extraction the product is filtered, then tested for itâ€™s
      concentration.    


      **Difficulties in Determining Concentration**


      The new curcumin reaction taking place in the lab could possibly be very
      useful.  However, HPLC has confirmed that the reaction produces a number
      of side products, which is not uncommon or unexpected.  This means it will
      be impossible to determine the extinction coefficient of the new
      compound.  The extinction coefficient is necessary to determine the
      concentration of this new compound in solution.  UV spectra will have to
      serve only as a means of determining the maximum wavelength of the
      compound.  Once an LCMS spectra is run, it will be easier to separate the
      major product of the reaction from the other side products.

      **Argus Lab Testing:**


      When the chemical structure of a molecule changes, it's maximum wavelength
      changes as well.  This can be observed visually by a color change.  That
      color change can be measured quantitatively using UV-Vis spectroscopy.


      This week it was observed that when curcumin is reacted with yeast, there
      is a loss of color.  This means that curcumin is undergoing a structural
      change.  This structural change will eventually be identified using NMR. 
      Before an NMR spectra is run, the chemical modeling software Argus Lab can
      be used comparatively with UV-Vis spectra to anticipate possible
      structural changes.

      **Using HPLC to Test Curcumin Samples**


      Above is a brief visual of the process of the HPLC


      HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography Instrument) is used to
      separate the injected substance based on polarity. The instrument detects
      what wavelength the substance absorbs ultraviolet rays. The results are
      shown on the chrotagram as a series of peaks with y-axis as milli-Volts
      vs. time on the x-axis. The detection wavelength was set to 440 nm and
      then to 280nm. Multiple curcumin substances were evaluated before
      potentially being added to the sunscreen.

      The picture above is an example of chromatogram results from an HPLC which
      displays the different peaks of the substance.

      **Different Ratios in Sunscreen**


      On Wednesday, 10 different sunscreens were made for future testing.  Five
      had zinc oxide (ZnO) and the other five did not.  Each group of five had
      consistently increasing amounts of curcumin.  Increasing the amount of
      curcumin in the sunscreens meant also increasing the amount of alcohol in
      the sunscreen because the curcumin is kept in an ethanol solution as it is
      not water soluble.  Increasing the amount of alcohol in the sunscreen
      meant that the more curcumin solution that was added, the more runny the
      resulting sunscreen would become.  The results of the sunscreens initially
      did not show an exact pattern of increasing or decreasing viscosity,
      however once the sunscreens were left overnight, they all became more
      evenly viscous.

      **Types of UV Radiation: Our Objective**


      There are three types of ultraviolet radiation.


      * UVC: The germicidal region, from 200-290 nm.

      * UVB: The erythmal region, from 290-320 nm, responsible for sunburns.

      * UVA: The 'tanning' region, from 320-400 nm, responsible for accelerated
      aging of the skin. 


      UVA radiation is considered the most dangerous for several reasons.  Most
      ultraviolet radiation reaching the Earth's surface is UVA.  Most
      photosensitivity is caused by UVA.  Also, UVA radiation can pass through
      some glass and plastic while UVB generally cannot.  UVA is also the type
      of ultraviolet radiation responsible for loss of skin elasticity, which
      causes the aforementioned accelerated aging of the skin.


      Our research will focus on blocking UVA and UVB using sunscreen that will
      be made from zinc oxide and curcumin.

      **First Extraction**


      In order to separate the curcumin from the turmeric powder, an extraction
      process was used where the dehydrated alcohol was the solvent and the
      turmeric powder was the solute.

      **Making Methyl Stearate** 


      * Methyl stearate made to be used as an emulsifier for the cream. 

      * Stearic acid, methanol, and sulfuric acid were mixed and heated for 1
      hour. The mixture was filtered and then washed three times with ice water
      and one time with acetone.


      ![](/img/screen-shot-2019-10-11-at-7.03.52-pm.png)


      * Once the substance dried, it was able to be used as an emulsifier for
      the cream


      **Testing Self Made Methyl Stearate** 


      The Testing of  Methyl Stearate includes checking the product under
      infrared along with recording its melting point. 


      The infrared results of the laboratory made Methyl Stearate must be
      compared with the infrared results   of stearic acid and commercial grade
      methyl stearate 


      **The process was started by making three different test solution
      samples:** 


      1. Solution of stearic acid and dichloromethane  

      2. Solution of commercial grade methyl stearate 

      3. Solution of self made methyl stearate

      **Standardization of Turmeric**


      After refluxing the turmeric and ethanol, the solution was diluted and run
      through the ultraviolet spectrometer.  The concentration of the solution
      was found to be 0.0113M curcumin.  This information was then used to
      calculate the amount of curcumin in the powdered turmeric by mass.


      The turmeric being used in the lab was confirmed to be 5% curcumin by
      mass.
