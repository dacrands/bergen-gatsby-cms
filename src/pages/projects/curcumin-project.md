title: Investigation of Biochemical Properties of Curcumin

abstract: >
  The project objective is to create two products using curcumin, a hand cream
  to help with inflammation caused by arthritis and a UVA/UVB blocking sunscreen
  using Zinc Oxide as a physical blocker and curcumin as a chemical blocker. 
  Curcumin is very similar in structure to many other organic chemical blockers
  that block UVB radiation. Our hypothesis is that the similar structure of
  curcumin will allow it to act as an effective chemical UVB blocker while
  simultaneously contributing antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties to
  the sunscreen.

      **Types of UV Radiation: Our Objective**


      There are three types of ultraviolet radiation.


      * UVC: The germicidal region, from 200-290 nm.

      * UVB: The erythmal region, from 290-320 nm, responsible for sunburns.

      * UVA: The 'tanning' region, from 320-400 nm, responsible for accelerated
      aging of the skin. 


      UVA radiation is considered the most dangerous for several reasons.  Most
      ultraviolet radiation reaching the Earth's surface is UVA.  Most
      photosensitivity is caused by UVA.  Also, UVA radiation can pass through
      some glass and plastic while UVB generally cannot.  UVA is also the type
      of ultraviolet radiation responsible for loss of skin elasticity, which
      causes the aforementioned accelerated aging of the skin.


      Our research will focus on blocking UVA and UVB using sunscreen that will
      be made from zinc oxide and curcumin.

      **First Extraction**


      In order to separate the curcumin from the turmeric powder, an extraction
      process was used where the dehydrated alcohol was the solvent and the
      turmeric powder was the solute.

      **Making Methyl Stearate** 


      * Methyl stearate made to be used as an emulsifier for the cream. 

      * Stearic acid, methanol, and sulfuric acid were mixed and heated for 1
      hour. The mixture was filtered and then washed three times with ice water
      and one time with acetone.

      * Once the substance dried, it was able to be used as an emulsifier for
      the cream


      **Testing Self Made Methyl Stearate** 


      The Testing of  Methyl Stearate includes checking the product under
      infrared along with recording its melting point. 


      The infrared results of the laboratory made Methyl Stearate must be
      compared with the infrared results   of stearic acid and commercial grade
      methyl stearate 


      **The process was started by making three different test solution
      samples:** 


      1. Solution of stearic acid and dichloromethane  

      2. Solution of commercial grade methyl stearate 

      3. Solution of self made methyl stearate

      **Standardization of Turmeric**


      After refluxing the turmeric and ethanol, the solution was diluted and run
      through the ultraviolet spectrometer.  The concentration of the solution
      was found to be 0.0113M curcumin.  This information was then used to
      calculate the amount of curcumin in the powdered turmeric by mass.


      The turmeric being used in the lab was confirmed to be 5% curcumin by
      mass.
