title: Investigation of Biochemical Properties of Curcumin

abstract: >
  The project objective is to create two products using curcumin, a hand cream
  to help with inflammation caused by arthritis and a UVA/UVB blocking sunscreen
  using Zinc Oxide as a physical blocker and curcumin as a chemical blocker. 
  Curcumin is very similar in structure to many other organic chemical blockers
  that block UVB radiation. Our hypothesis is that the similar structure of
  curcumin will allow it to act as an effective chemical UVB blocker while
  simultaneously contributing antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties to
  the sunscreen.
meeting: Monday 10-3pm and Thursday in SA116
