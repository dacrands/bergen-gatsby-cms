      Since the aim of the project is to create a robotic arm with the same
      articulation and coordination as a human arm, it is extremely crucial for
      all of the team members to have an in-depth knowledge and understanding of
      the anatomy of a human arm. This week the team focused on expanding their
      knowledge of human arm structure and functions through intensive research.
      The skeleton of the human arm will be 3D printed in the upcoming weeks
      using PLA Filament. Simultaneously, some members looked into the subject
      of artificial muscles. Through his rigorous research, Patrick discovered a
      fairly new way of making artificial muscles using Nylon fibers as
      discovered by MIT Engineers.

      Next week, we'll continue with the research and hopefully start testing
      the nylon fibers. We also plan on searching about how to coil the fibers
      to make the muscles. Meanwhile, other members will start working on the
      Graphical User Interface (GUI). The idea is to use a 3D-modelling or
      animating software to create a human arm with all the bones and muscles to
      control the robotic arm.

  - body: "Previously work uncovered the possibility of utilizing nylon as a synthetic muscle. However, the articles found suggested that the nylon may require temperatures exceeding 170 degrees Celsius to match the biological function that it would mimic. Thus, farther research was deemed necessary. This week, more in-depth research into polymer usage as artificial muscles was conducted. Polyethylene was the material of focus. An analysis suggests that Linear Low-Density Polyethylene, or LLDPE, may be a more efficient alternative to the nylon. It would require temperatures at a maximum of one hundred degrees Celsius to achieve results matching the biological functions. This difference is desirable because it will lead to lower energy requirements, and cause fewer issues for any complimentary material. Many other polyethylene compounds also require a lower temperature for similar performance than the nylon compounds. Thus, alongside the nylon, polyethylene will be tested.\r\n\n\r\n\nAlong with the research, work on the graphical user interface, or GUI (also used for general user interface), has started. The GUI was envisioned to be an anatomically accurate human arm that could be manipulated to manipulate the robotic arm. The first obstacle to overcome was finding a development software. It is unfortunate that no one on the team is proficient in any 3D modeling and animation software. Thus, research into possible software was required. After assessing numerous programs including unity, SolidWorks, and AutoDesk's fusion, AutoDesk's Maya was ultimately selected. Then, the process of learning the software and using it started. Fortunately, a usable skeleton model was found to provide a starting point for the GUI. The following image is the current state of the GUI.\n\n\n\nTo read more regarding the nylon and polyethylene synthetic muscles, view these links:\n\n<https://www.polymersolutions.com/blog/artificial-muscles-from-cheap-polymer-fibers/>\n\n<https://www.nature.com/articles/srep36358>"
