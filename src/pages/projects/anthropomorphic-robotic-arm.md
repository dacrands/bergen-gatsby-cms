      It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the
      readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using
      Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters,
      as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like
      readable English. 


      Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum
      as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover
      many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over
      the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour
      and the like).

## Objective

Since the aim of the project is to create a robotic arm with the same articulation and coordination as a human arm, it is extremely crucial for all of the team members to have an in-depth knowledge and understanding of the anatomy of a human arm. 

This week the team focused on expanding their knowledge of human arm structure and functions through intensive research. The skeleton of the human arm will be 3D printed in the upcoming weeks using PLA Filament. Simultaneously, some members looked into the subject of artificial muscles. Through his rigorous research, Patrick discovered a fairly new way of making artificial muscles using Nylon fibers as discovered by MIT Engineers. To learn more, click the link below:
