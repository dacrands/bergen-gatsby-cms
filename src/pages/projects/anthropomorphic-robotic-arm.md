      Previously work uncovered the possibility of utilizing nylon as a
      synthetic muscle. However, the articles found suggested that the nylon may
      require temperatures exceeding 170 degrees Celsius to match the biological
      function that it would mimic. Thus, farther research was deemed necessary.
      This week, more in-depth research into polymer usage as artificial muscles
      was conducted. Polyethylene was the material of focus. An analysis
      suggests that Linear Low-Density Polyethylene, or LLDPE, may be a more
      efficient alternative to the nylon. It would require temperatures at a
      maximum of one hundred degrees Celsius to achieve results matching the
      biological functions. This difference is desirable because it will lead to
      lower energy requirements, and cause fewer issues for any complimentary
      material. Many other polyethylene compounds also require a lower
      temperature for similar performance than the nylon compounds. Thus,
      alongside the nylon, polyethylene will be tested.

      As stated last week, work on GUI has started. The process of placing and
      labeling the joints for the expected movement of the bones at joints was
      fairly complicated at first. Once a joint is a placed, the bones will be
      allowed to move in all three axes: x, y, and z. Now, the team had to
      figure out how to put limitations on the degrees of rotation or movement
      for each bone in the design. While placing the joints, the team learned
      that they must be placed inside one of the bones at the joints, for the
      bones to not overlap each other during the motion.

## Objective

Since the aim of the project is to create a robotic arm with the same articulation and coordination as a human arm, it is extremely crucial for all of the team members to have an in-depth knowledge and understanding of the anatomy of a human arm. 

This week the team focused on expanding their knowledge of human arm structure and functions through intensive research. The skeleton of the human arm will be 3D printed in the upcoming weeks using PLA Filament. Simultaneously, some members looked into the subject of artificial muscles. Through his rigorous research, Patrick discovered a fairly new way of making artificial muscles using Nylon fibers as discovered by MIT Engineers. To learn more, click the link below:
