      The purpose of lorem ipsum is to create a natural looking block of text
      (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) that doesn't distract from the layout. A
      practice not without controversy, laying out pages with meaningless filler
      text can be very useful when the focus is meant to be on design, not
      content.


      The passage experienced a surge in popularity during the 1960s when
      Letraset used it on their dry-transfer sheets, and again during the 90s as
      desktop publishers bundled the text with their software. Today it's seen
      all around the web; on templates, websites, and stock designs. Use our
      generator to get your own, or read on for the authoritative history of
      lorem ipsum.
