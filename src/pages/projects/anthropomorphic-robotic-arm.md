      Last week, the team built the apparatus to start coiling the two plastic
      fibers: Nylon and Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene. We used two
      types of equipment for the twisting and coiling of the fibers. To the left
      is the drill set up, which was tested last week. However, with the drill,
      the speed at which the fiber is coiled is inconsistent. So, the team
      decided to build another set up that will allow the fibers to twist and
      coil at a constant speed. As you see in the figure, to the right is our
      second set up using a servo motor that allows consistent rotation of the
      fibers to create the coils.

      The most manageable means of powering the actuator was deemed to be
      electrothermal heating. Electrothermal heating is the conversion of
      electric energy to thermal energy for the purpose of producing heat. This
      is done by running an electric current through a resistor and that leads
      to the resistor heating up. a common example of a resistor is a copper
      wire.


      After deciding on the heat source, it was time to work on fabricating the
      material. So, we started looking into means of applying the twist to the
      string. To do so, we decided to find an elevated platform on which we plan
      to attach an electric drill with a hook as the drill bit. Then, we would
      tie the ends of the fiber onto paper clips. one paper clip would be placed
      onto the hook, and the other would have a rotationally fixed weight placed
      on it.

      As stated last week, work on GUI has started. The process of placing and
      labeling the joints for the expected movement of the bones at joints was
      fairly complicated at first. Once a joint is a placed, the bones will be
      allowed to move in all three axes: x, y, and z. Now, the team had to
      figure out how to put limitations on the degrees of rotation or movement
      for each bone in the design. While placing the joints, the team learned
      that they must be placed inside one of the bones at the joints, for the
      bones to not overlap each other during the motion.

      Previously work uncovered the possibility of utilizing nylon as a
      synthetic muscle. However, the articles found suggested that the nylon may
      require temperatures exceeding 170 degrees Celsius to match the biological
      function that it would mimic. Thus, farther research was deemed necessary.
      This week, more in-depth research into polymer usage as artificial muscles
      was conducted. Polyethylene was the material of focus. An analysis
      suggests that Linear Low-Density Polyethylene, or LLDPE, may be a more
      efficient alternative to the nylon. It would require temperatures at a
      maximum of one hundred degrees Celsius to achieve results matching the
      biological functions. This difference is desirable because it will lead to
      lower energy requirements, and cause fewer issues for any complimentary
      material. Many other polyethylene compounds also require a lower
      temperature for similar performance than the nylon compounds. Thus,
      alongside the nylon, polyethylene will be tested.

## Objective

Since the aim of the project is to create a robotic arm with the same articulation and coordination as a human arm, it is extremely crucial for all of the team members to have an in-depth knowledge and understanding of the anatomy of a human arm. 

This week the team focused on expanding their knowledge of human arm structure and functions through intensive research. The skeleton of the human arm will be 3D printed in the upcoming weeks using PLA Filament. Simultaneously, some members looked into the subject of artificial muscles. Through his rigorous research, Patrick discovered a fairly new way of making artificial muscles using Nylon fibers as discovered by MIT Engineers. To learn more, click the link below:
