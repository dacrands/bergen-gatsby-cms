      Previously work uncovered the possibility of utilizing nylon as a
      synthetic muscle. However, the articles found suggested that the nylon may
      require temperatures exceeding 170 degrees Celsius to match the biological
      function that it would mimic. Thus, farther research was deemed necessary.
      This week, more in-depth research into polymer usage as artificial muscles
      was conducted. Polyethylene was the material of focus. An analysis
      suggests that Linear Low-Density Polyethylene, or LLDPE, may be a more
      efficient alternative to the nylon. It would require temperatures at a
      maximum of one hundred degrees Celsius to achieve results matching the
      biological functions. This difference is desirable because it will lead to
      lower energy requirements, and cause fewer issues for any complimentary
      material. Many other polyethylene compounds also require a lower
      temperature for similar performance than the nylon compounds. Thus,
      alongside the nylon, polyethylene will be tested.

      of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is
      that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to
      using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.
      Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum
      as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover
      many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over
      the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour

## Objective

Since the aim of the project is to create a robotic arm with the same articulation and coordination as a human arm, it is extremely crucial for all of the team members to have an in-depth knowledge and understanding of the anatomy of a human arm. 

This week the team focused on expanding their knowledge of human arm structure and functions through intensive research. The skeleton of the human arm will be 3D printed in the upcoming weeks using PLA Filament. Simultaneously, some members looked into the subject of artificial muscles. Through his rigorous research, Patrick discovered a fairly new way of making artificial muscles using Nylon fibers as discovered by MIT Engineers. To learn more, click the link below:
