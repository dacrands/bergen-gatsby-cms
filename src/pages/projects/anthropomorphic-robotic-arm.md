  Building a Anthropomorphic robotic arm that is able to attain the same or the
  equivalence of human coordination and articulation by engineering off of human
  anatomy.

  - body: "Since the aim of the project is to create a robotic arm with the same articulation and coordination as a human arm, it is extremely crucial for all of the team members to have an in-depth knowledge and understanding of the anatomy of a human arm. This week the team focused on expanding their knowledge of human arm structure and functions through intensive research. The skeleton of the human arm will be 3D printed in the upcoming weeks using PLA Filament. Simultaneously, some members looked into the subject of artificial muscles. Through his rigorous research, Patrick discovered a fairly new way of making artificial muscles using Nylon fibers as discovered by MIT Engineers. To learn more, click the link below:\r\n\n<http://news.mit.edu/2016/nylon-muscle-fibers-1123>\n\n\n\nNext week, we'll continue with the research and hopefully start testing the nylon fibers. We also plan on searching about how to coil the fibers to make the muscles. Meanwhile, other members will start working on the Graphical User Interface (GUI). The idea is to use a 3D-modelling or animating software to create a human arm with all the bones and muscles to control the robotic arm."
