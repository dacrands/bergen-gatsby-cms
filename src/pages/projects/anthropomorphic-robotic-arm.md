title: Anthropomorphic Robotic Arm
image: /img/robot-arm.jpeg
abstract: >-
  The goal of our project is to develop an anthropomorphic robotic arm which
  closely mimics the functions and capabilities of an average human arm. Through
  literature reviews and results verification, we have found that LLDPE, UHMWPE,
  PET, and polycarbonate could be used as replacements for muscle, cartilage,
  ligament, and bone respectively.

  - body: "The most manageable means of powering the actuator was deemed to be electrothermal heating. Electrothermal heating is the conversion of electric energy to thermal energy for the purpose of producing heat. This is done by running an electric current through a resistor and that leads to the resistor heating up. a common example of a resistor is a copper wire.\r\n\n\r\n\nAfter deciding on the heat source, it was time to work on fabricating the material. So, we started looking into means of applying the twist to the string. To do so, we decided to find an elevated platform on which we plan to attach an electric drill with a hook as the drill bit. Then, we would tie the ends of the fiber onto paper clips. one paper clip would be placed onto the hook, and the other would have a rotationally fixed weight placed on it.\r\n\n\r\n\nWe completed that setup and tested it by producing a sample twisted polyethylene fiber."

      At the beginning of the week, the team researched alternative materials
      for use in the heating element coating. First, the team took a second look
      at the conductive silver paint used by other researchers such as from MIT.
      The paint they used was a combination of silver pigment in a polyvinyl
      resin. Therefore, our first look into alternative materials were more
      capable polyvinyl resins (other than Elmer's glue). While the team did
      find other polyvinyl resins, the material has a lower than required
      working temperature. Therefore, using it as a heating element to actuate
      nylon may have adverse effects and lead to accelerated degradation of the
      coating. 


      The team then looked into solvents and materials closely related to the
      TCP material. Meaning, the team looked at a solvent for nylon and a
      solvent for LLDPE (the intended actuator used for the actual arm). First,
      the team looked into the chemical resistance of nylon and LLDPE and looked
      for an adequate solvent —one that is relatively less caustic to use and
      also readily available. However, this proved to be a challenge finding a
      suitable solvent for nylon since many forms of nylon are chemically
      resistant to common solvents such as acetone. However, what was found was
      that a certain subtype of nylon 6 called Elvamide can be dissolved in
      ethanol and methanol. Future testing of this material along with an
      ethanol solvent will hopefully be done later this summer. 


      As for a suitable LLDPE solvent, literature shows that acetone can
      dissolve polyethylene at increased temperatures. Preliminary testing of
      acetone and polyethylene at room temperature was conducted by the team but
      showed no signs of dissolving. Further testing at increased temperatures
      should be tested. It is also noted that the acetone used was from nail
      polish remover, thus the concentration of acetone was not pure. An
      alternative to acetone found is Xylene, which is a cheap, commonly used
      paint stripper and can be bought at home improvement stores. Further
      testing is required to determine whether it is suitable for our usage. 


      Once the team has a suitable plastic w/ solvent mixture, testing with
      various graphite concentrations within the mixture can resume. 


      The team also put together the Filastruder needed to create our own LLDPE
      filament as well as recycle print waste from all projects that use the 3D
      printer.

      We also continued to try to source materials and attempted to test what
      systems we do have. We, however, found that some complications have arisen
      due to the recent move to the new STEM center, leading to tools and
      equipment being misplaced. So, we began to work to locate said tools and
      equipment.


      In addition, We spent some time preparing for the presentation we had on
      Thursday. We reiterated the main aspects of the work thus far to the new
      members. We also practiced our presentations and gave each other feedback
      to improve individual presentation skills.


      We contacted suppliers to find the coolants. We collected data of coolants
      (physical and chemical properties) that we found and put it in the data
      table (Figure06). One issue is some suppliers and manufacturers don’t
      provide all information that we need to know about the oil. As a Result,
      parts of the data table are without some information (Figure 07). They
      still an option because of the boiling point, and viscosity.

      We finished writing the GUI. We uploaded the main branch to GitHub using
      the account patrick1964 so that any modifications may be version
      controlled. We also continued trying to source some LLDPE and PET by
      contacting some suppliers. The issue we are running into is that, while
      the material is very common, most suppliers of the raw material sell using
      units of metric tons. So, we contacted them to ask if they would be
      willing to supply such small quantities. 


      The team also continued working on developing a conductive coating. The
      next mixture tested was Bombay Black ink with graphite powder mixed in
      solution. The graphite was mixed with the same percentages used with the
      Elmers glue and graphite mixtures. A surprising result was that the
      control sample of just the Bombay Black ink proved to be conductive but
      with very high resistance —along the lines of 1.5 to 3 K ohms. The first
      mixture tested was 1 ml Ink to 0.04g graphite powder; this solution proved
      to be the least resistant out of all ink/graphite mixtures tested with a
      resistance approximately 0.7 M ohms. What was also a surprise is that the
      next large percentage tested, 0.08g graphite to 1ml ink, had resistance
      values around 30 to 120 K ohm. Then as the amount of graphite in solution
      is increased per sample, the resistance lowered down to around 5K Ohms.

      All samples tested proved to have a consistent and thin layer. More
      importantly, all samples had excellent adhesion to the plastic tape
      backing. Abrasion resistance should be tested more thoroughly, however,
      the team noted that the higher concentration of graphite samples had
      visible residue when abraded onto another piece of paper to test for
      abrasion resistance.

      We did more research about different coolant that we can use for cooling.
      we created a data table (Figure 6 ) that we intend to populate with data
      relevant for the coolant. The data table has information about the
      physical and chemical properties of the coolant. We need to know this
      information before deciding if it is a good coolant for cooling our
      system.

      We started looking into different languages and IDEs to create a simple
      GUI to test single muscle fibers or muscle groups. Eventually, we settled
      on using Java with the Eclipse IDE. Java’s AWT and swift libraries in
      association with Eclipe’s window builder will help make the build easier.
      We also welcomed two new members to the project and caught them up to our
      progress. 


      We also began research on coolant liquids for the cooling system. The
      coolant liquid cannot conduct electricity and it needs to have a higher
      boiling point than expected heat element temperature. we found that two
      common dielectric coolants are silicone oil and mineral oil. They are used
      to cool down transformers. Further research is required to determine
      whether or not we can use them.


      The team also worked on developing an adequate heating element which will
      coat the nylon (and in the future: LLDPE) actuators. Heating element
      coating must be flexible enough to withstand constant compression and
      movement due to actuation of the TCP. Furthermore, the coating must be
      electrically conductive and withstand high temperatures --upwards of 200C
      due to nylon actuates around that temperature. The team started with
      Elmer's glue which is a polyvinyl acetate glue. The Elmers glue is mixed
      with varying amounts of graphite powder (measured in grams from 0g to 0.7g
      of powder in 0.1g increments). The team then conducted a smear test, as
      seen in figure 1, with every sample by applying a small amount onto a
      piece of paper lined in plastic tape and then, using a squeegee, smearing
      the sample to a uniform and flat layer. All samples were tested twice with
      a thinner layer and a thicker layer to determine whether layer thickness
      contributes to adhesion and flexibility. The samples were dried and then
      tested for conductivity using a multimeter. The team found that a sample
      mixture of Elmer's glue with 2.5mL glue to 0.6g graphite powder is
      conductive. Mixtures lower than 0.6g graphite powder were deemed
      non-conductive and mixtures with over 0.7g graphite powder were
      conductive. However, the mixture of Elmer’s glue and 0.6g graphite powder
      showed the highest adhesion and flexibility among the conductive samples
      most likely due to the lower amount of graphite mixed in. Furthermore, a
      thinner layer of the sample proved to be much more resilient than the same
      sample applied at a larger thickness; this property should be tested much
      more thoroughly once an ideal material is found.
