title: 'High Altitude Balloon '
image: /img/hab.png
abstract: >-
  An extension of lessons learned from Bergen Community Collegeâ€™s ongoing High
  Altitude Balloon Program prompted the development of a meteor dust capture and
  return mission initiated during the summer of 2018. A novel mechanism is being
  designed and manufactured to allow the capture of meteor dust at altitudes
  greater than 60,000 feet. Unique microprocessor flight software is being
  developed to enable operation of the hardware, record information gathered by
  temperature, humidity, and pressure sensors, and conduct a sound level vs air
  pressure experiment.
