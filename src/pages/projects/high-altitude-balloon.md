title: Atmospheric Particle Sampling With a High Altitude Balloon
image: /img/hab.png
abstract: >-
  An extension of lessons learned from Bergen Community College’s ongoing High
  Altitude Balloon Program prompted the development of a meteor dust capture and
  return mission initiated during the summer of 2018. A novel mechanism is being
  designed and manufactured to allow the capture of meteor dust at altitudes
  greater than 60,000 feet. Unique microprocessor flight software is being
  developed to enable operation of the hardware, record information gathered by
  temperature, humidity, and pressure sensors, and conduct a sound level vs air
  pressure experiment.

      * **General**


      We discussed when we are going to launch the experiment as well as what to
      implement from a meeting last week. We will likely launch on August 13th
      (a Tuesday) and will use a long cord/tether between the balloon,
      parachute, and command module as a safeguard against landing in a tree.


      * **CAD**


      We are printing the holder components for the circuit board and
      cutting/drilling holes for the cameras and rods into the box we are using
      for the launch. We also sanded the lids to add more clearance.


      * **Circuitry**


      We are wiring up the electronics for the final assembly.


      * **Cameras**


      A brief test confirmed that the Hero3+ cameras will be able to record the
      dish assemblies operating.


      * **General**


      We tested assembling the command module and took inventory of our
      supplies. We are expecting to launch the balloon next Tuesday or next
      Thursday.


      * **CAD**


      After several reprints, a holder for the circuit board has been completed
      and integrated into the design. Additionally, we prepared a mylar radar
      reflector for air traffic safety.


      * **Circuitry**


      As far as we can tell, the circuit board is finished. To resolve an issue
      in which the motors could not move the sliding doors in the dish
      assemblies, the doors were sanded thinner and lubricated with silicone
      grease.

      * **General**


      We proofread and revised the volunteer form for the launch.


      * **CAD**


      The second Hero3+ case has been printed. Work is underway to develop the
      holder for the circuit board.


      * **Circuitry**


      Despite a small redesign, the circuit board as been assembled and is being
      soldered.


      **General**


      We took inventory of our tools, supplies, etc., again.


      * **CAD**


      The box is being modified for the insertion of the carbon fiber rods. The
      circuit board holder has been modeled and the rim pieces of the dish
      assemblies are being sanded to resolve an issue with the sliding doors.


      * **Circuitry**


      The board needs to be reprinted due to layering issues.


      * **Cameras**


      We tested the batteries to see if they can last at least six hours. At the
      three hours and thirty minutes mark, the battery was at half power. We are
      expecting the flight to be six hours at most and the battery is estimated
      to last a total of seven hours powering the cameras.

      * **General**


      Earlier into the Summer II semester, we discussed using lithium of
      silicone grease for the sliding doors if necessary. We did some research
      on which to use should the dish assemblies fail in an upcoming freezer
      test. Silicone grease appears to be a better option given that it was
      intended for plastic, rubber, etc. and works in cold temperatures.

      * **CAD**


      One of the camera casing assemblies has been printed. We are also printing
      another copy of the new rim piece for the dish assembly.


      ![](/img/screen-shot-2019-08-27-at-3.02.24-pm.png)


      Furthermore, we tested attaching the dish assemblies, the carbon fiber
      rods, and the styrofoam box. Everything fits bar one of the holes for the
      screws, which will need to be fixed.


      ![](/img/screen-shot-2019-08-27-at-3.06.46-pm.png)


      * **Circuitry**


      Originally the circuit board logged data only if the GPS was getting a
      signal.  We edited the code to log data from the other sensors even if the
      GPS loses its signal.


      * **Cameras**


      We tested two of the GoPro Sessions (labeled 2 and 3) in the pressure
      chamber. Both cameras continued to operate throughout the changes in
      pressure. Afterward, they were left on to test how long they could
      function normally. One deactivated once the battery’s power dropped to
      around 25%, followed by the other one about a minute later.


      * **CAD**


      A copy of our custom GoPro Session casing is being printed.


      * **Circuitry**


      We finished building the circuit board for the speaker.


      ![](/img/screen-shot-2019-08-27-at-3.08.10-pm.png)


      * **Cameras**


      We tested the cameras’ built-in microphone by checking whether or not they
      can record the sound from the speaker circuit. We also made and applied
      better labels to the cameras. The Hero3+ cameras were kept labeled 1
      through 4, but the Session cameras were relabeled from 1 through 3 to 5
      through 7 respectively.


      * **CAD**


      Yesterday we rethreaded the holes for the limit switch pins and secured
      the motors to the new rim pieces and printed the Session casing. The print
      was warped upon completion but was unwarped into a useable state via a
      heat gun.


      Today, we finished marking where to cut the box and punched holes through
      the said areas for the wire cutter. We are also printing the second Hero3+
      casing.


      * **Circuitry**


      We are continuing to develop the main circuit board.


      * **Cameras**


      Camera battery power draw


      GoPro 3+ Silver will draw approximately 1/10(10%) of the battery’s power (
      10,000 MAmp) per hour.


      These calculations proved correct for about 25% of the battery was gone an
      hour and 10 minutes into the recording


      GoPro Session 5 will draw approximately ⅙ (17.333%) Per hour of batteries
      power (10,000MAmp)


      **Cameras started at 10:55**

      This photo from the 2017 launch demonstrates how large the balloon is, as
      well as how long the cord is between the balloon and the payload and where
      the parachute is positioned along the said chord.


      * **CAD**


      The second rail has been printed with minor stringing and minor layer
      separation. A third attempt may be in order if need be.


      The lid for the second dish assembly is being printed.


      * **Camera**


      We tested the cameras and battery packs once more to determine whether it
      was Camera 1 or Battery Pack 2 that kept failing. Camera 1 was connected
      to Battery Pack 2 and Camera 4 was connected to Battery Pack 1. As the
      pressure dropped in the pressure chamber, Camera 1 failed and shut down,
      indicating that it was defective while Battery Pack 1 continued to
      operate.


      * **General**


      We compiled a checklist of what we need for the setup and launch of the
      experiment.


      * **CAD**


      The lid has been printed but needed to be sanded down. We also honed our
      skills with the modeling software by using the information learned from
      the Fusion 360 mini-course.


      * **Circuitry**


      The circuit board for a signal emitter was designed.

      The styrofoam box we are using has been marked to indicate where to cut
      for inserting the camera assemblies. Additionally, a GCODE file of the
      camera casing printable has been compiled for the LulzBot printer.

      * **General**


      Today is the start of the Summer II internship/semester. We are still
      waiting to hear back from SDL about the 3D printers. Until then, we are
      unable to print components nor circuit boards.


      * **CAD**


      We made a slight revision to the camera casing assembly model by making
      the hole for the record button wider (diameter increased from about 16.5
      mm to 18 mm).


      * **Circuit**


      We attempted to improve the altitude parsing of our GPS units.


      * **General**


      We have a new team member who will be joining the CAD team. We are still
      at a standstill until the liability forms come in. An early draft of a
      powerpoint presentation is being compiled to maintain productivity.


      * **CAD**


      We discussed modifying the camera assembly to take advantage of the slots
      for the stand. The change would involve adding an axel to better lock the
      camera in place. We decided against it, however, because the axel would
      prove redundant and would make the assembly of the component too complex.


      We also drilled guide holes into the carbon fiber rods we are using to
      mound the dish assemblies. We are placing an order for the correct drill
      size for the screws in the dish assembly to fit through.


      * **Circuit**


      We tested the APRS again by walking around the Paramus campus with it. The
      APRS was able to pick up data as it was carried around the football field,
      but only picked up three pings (one by the Pitkin Building where it was
      activated, one by the Technology Building, and the other by the field
      despite making several laps).


      * **General**


      We now have access to a pressure chamber for simulating the low air
      pressure the payload will be operating in. To safely and effectively use
      it, we will need:


      1. Safety goggles

      2. Vacuum grease

      3. Class D fire extinguisher


      * **CAD**


      We began working on a holder for the circuit board. It will use screws and
      posts to keep the board suspended and secured and will replace the velcro
      we were going to use.


      * **Circuitry**


      We tested the circuit board and its pressure sensor in the vacuum chamber.
      The board worked and collected data from the pressure drop down to 210
      Torr.
