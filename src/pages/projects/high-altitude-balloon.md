title: Atmospheric Particle Sampling With a High Altitude Balloon
image: /img/hab.png
abstract: >-
  An extension of lessons learned from Bergen Community College’s ongoing High
  Altitude Balloon Program prompted the development of a meteor dust capture and
  return mission initiated during the summer of 2018. A novel mechanism is being
  designed and manufactured to allow the capture of meteor dust at altitudes
  greater than 60,000 feet. Unique microprocessor flight software is being
  developed to enable operation of the hardware, record information gathered by
  temperature, humidity, and pressure sensors, and conduct a sound level vs air
  pressure experiment.

      * **General**


      This photo from the 2017 launch demonstrates how large the balloon is, as
      well as how long the cord is between the balloon and the payload and where
      the parachute is positioned along the said chord.


      * **CAD**


      The second rail has been printed with minor stringing and minor layer
      separation. A third attempt may be in order if need be.


      The lid for the second dish assembly is being printed.


      * **Camera**


      We tested the cameras and battery packs once more to determine whether it
      was Camera 1 or Battery Pack 2 that kept failing. Camera 1 was connected
      to Battery Pack 2 and Camera 4 was connected to Battery Pack 1. As the
      pressure dropped in the pressure chamber, Camera 1 failed and shut down,
      indicating that it was defective while Battery Pack 1 continued to
      operate.


      * **General**


      We compiled a checklist of what we need for the setup and launch of the
      experiment.


      * **CAD**


      The lid has been printed but needed to be sanded down. We also honed our
      skills with the modeling software by using the information learned from
      the Fusion 360 mini-course.


      * **Circuitry**


      The circuit board for a signal emitter was designed.

      The styrofoam box we are using has been marked to indicate where to cut
      for inserting the camera assemblies. Additionally, a GCODE file of the
      camera casing printable has been compiled for the LulzBot printer.

      A camera assembly and the bottom holder for the second dish assembly are
      being printed. We may reprint the lids to incorporate a layer of epoxy to
      better preserve any samples in the Petri dishes.

  - body: "* **General**\n\nWe have done some research on the effects of high altitudes on lithium and lithium-ion batteries such as the ones we are using. From what we have found, low pressure has little to no effect on the performance or stability of lithium-ion batteries. However, low temperatures can compromise battery performance; but our mentor has informed us that the temperature range the experiment will be experiencing will not be low enough to cause an issue.\n\n**Sources used:**\n\n1. https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/gadgets-computers-software/129323-li-ion-batteries-high-altitudes.html\n2. https://www.researchgate.net/post/What_is_the_impact_of_low_pressure_on_LIthium_Ion_batteries_WIll_cycle_life_change_if_I_use_them_above_4000m_height_with_low_pressure\n3. https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20130000451.pdf\n4. http://blog.ravpower.com/2017/05/protections-lithium-ion-batteries/\n5. https://forum.solar-electric.com/discussion/3945/high-altitude-affects-batteries\n6. https://www.instructables.com/id/The-Ultimate-High-Altitude-Weather-Balloon-Data-Lo/\n7. https://www.instructables.com/id/Scientific-Research-High-Altitude-Balloon-for-Fun-/\n\n* **Circuitry**\n\nWe have printed the circuit board for the tone projector.\n\n* **Camera**\n\nTomorrow we are going to test the cameras’ performance under low pressure.

The lowest the sensor was able to read was .16 bar, but the chamber was able to reach a pressure lower than that. The sensor was tweaked to read lower pressure and will be tested on Monday.\n\n* **CAD**\n\nWe have made a printable of the modified GoPro Session casing.\n\nWe started printing the rail of the second dish assembly yesterday, but the printer ran out of filament near the end of the print. We made some revisions to the Gcode of the component to reduce the amount of required plastic. The new version is being printed.\n\n* **Circuitry**\n\nThe traces and pads have been implemented.\n\n![](/img/screen-shot-2019-08-27-at-2.46.25-pm.png)\n\n* **Camera**\n\nWe repeated the experiment with the GoPro Hero3+ cameras in the pressure chamber. The results will be made available on Monday."

      * **General**


      Today is the start of the Summer II internship/semester. We are still
      waiting to hear back from SDL about the 3D printers. Until then, we are
      unable to print components nor circuit boards.


      * **CAD**


      We made a slight revision to the camera casing assembly model by making
      the hole for the record button wider (diameter increased from about 16.5
      mm to 18 mm).


      * **Circuit**


      We attempted to improve the altitude parsing of our GPS units.


      * **General**


      We have a new team member who will be joining the CAD team. We are still
      at a standstill until the liability forms come in. An early draft of a
      powerpoint presentation is being compiled to maintain productivity.


      * **CAD**


      We discussed modifying the camera assembly to take advantage of the slots
      for the stand. The change would involve adding an axel to better lock the
      camera in place. We decided against it, however, because the axel would
      prove redundant and would make the assembly of the component too complex.


      We also drilled guide holes into the carbon fiber rods we are using to
      mound the dish assemblies. We are placing an order for the correct drill
      size for the screws in the dish assembly to fit through.


      * **Circuit**


      We tested the APRS again by walking around the Paramus campus with it. The
      APRS was able to pick up data as it was carried around the football field,
      but only picked up three pings (one by the Pitkin Building where it was
      activated, one by the Technology Building, and the other by the field
      despite making several laps).


      * **General**


      We now have access to a pressure chamber for simulating the low air
      pressure the payload will be operating in. To safely and effectively use
      it, we will need:


      1. Safety goggles

      2. Vacuum grease

      3. Class D fire extinguisher


      * **CAD**


      We began working on a holder for the circuit board. It will use screws and
      posts to keep the board suspended and secured and will replace the velcro
      we were going to use.


      * **Circuitry**


      We tested the circuit board and its pressure sensor in the vacuum chamber.
      The board worked and collected data from the pressure drop down to 210
      Torr.
