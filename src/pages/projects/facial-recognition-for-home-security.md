  - body: "●\tStarted  researching ways to do the project resources for the project.\r\n\n●\tOur overall plan is to connect the camera and Microsoft azure which is a cloud API service with cognitive services capabilities that allow us to work with face detection, voice detection, etc. using this we confirm the face and tell the raspberry to open an electrical door lock if it is a valid person."
