abstract: >
  To build a functional Face Recognition system that can open a door, that was
  for the beginning, now the new objective is to make a facial recognition
  system and make work through a raspberry pi, so we can implement it in as many
  things as we can.

  - body: "笳十tStarted  researching ways to do the project resources for the project.\r\n\n笳十tOur overall plan is to connect the camera and Microsoft azure which is a cloud API service with cognitive services capabilities that allow us to work with face detection, voice detection, etc. using this we confirm the face and tell the raspberry to open an electrical door lock if it is a valid person."

  - body: "笳十tInstalled Microsoft IOT on the raspberry pi so that we can connect to a remote computer to the raspberry pi so that it does the process, and then tells the raspberry what to do.\n\n笳十tStarted looking for other methods for the use of facial recognition just in case that Microsoft azure does not work as well as we planned. In the process found out about Opencv an open source API used for image recognition, it can be used in may softwares andis free in contrast to Azure but because it not cloud based, we will need a way of processing the information in a decento computer and sent the results to the raspberry pi."
