      * Project Summary:


      The purpose of the project is to build an application(app) which will
      enable individuals to unsubscribe from their unwanted snail mail. U.S
      households receive unwanted junk mail on a daily basis. The app will help
      reduce the inflow of the snail mail, by creating an easy way to opt-out
      from the lists. 


      * Technical part of the project:


      Project will use the JavaScript programming language on the Ionic
      framework. The Ionic framework allows us to write the code for both IOS
      and Android platforms.


      The app will also contain a specific application programming interface
      (API) and optical character recognition (OCR). Alongside the API and the
      OCR algorithms, the app will have several databases for different
      purposes.
