      This week we presented our project to all of the other teams. A slide-show
      was created to showcase the project. The link to view it is included in
      this post. We brainstormed some features we would like to add to the app
      in the future and included them at the end of our presentation. These
      include bolstering our unsubscribe database, developing the app in Ionic,
      and creating our own API.

      Compiled a list of the companies which allow its users to opt-out from
      their servers and added the list to our Firebase. Now attempting to link
      the API to use data from the Firebase which is the first step of the
      process; putting in the request. 


      Hardcoded the “Unsubscribe” feature in the prototype for demonstration
      purposes. Currently trying to figure out how to legitimately unsubscribe
      the user from the sender automatically. This is the hardest part of the
      project, and we are brainstorming ideas. As an alternative, we are also
      implementing a form that allows the user to manually input information
      which would also unsubscribe them, except it would lack automation.

      Created some UI designs of the: Splash screen, Login screen, Home screen.
      Going to be implemented next week in Ionic with minimal
      functionality.(insert pics of GUI)


      Becoming more comfortable with Ionic to the point where we can rely on the
      Ionic documentation to guide us rather than tutorials. We learned what an
      API is, how it gets and returns data from a database, how to implement
      APIs in projects, what OCR is and how to use it, and finally how to
      connect back-end code to front-end code via routing and modules.

      Created a prototype app which accesses Firebase and the device’s camera.
      The app can query the database, and receive information. It should be
      noted that the prototype was built in Android Studios which uses the Java
      language. The next step would be to upload the code to the Github repo and
      then port the code into the Ionic framework.  (insert video and
      screenshots)


      Team members have been learning how to use JavaScript, Angular, and Ionic.
      These are the technologies required to work on the project. A “learn by
      doing” approach is being taken as each member is creating a small app on
      the Ionic framework. They also utilize OCR APIs and Firebase, technologies
      which are relevant to our project.


      A repository on Github was created for the project. This way everyone can
      work on the same files simultaneously, and test functionality.

      * Project Summary:


      The purpose of the project is to build an application(app) which will
      enable individuals to unsubscribe from their unwanted snail mail. U.S
      households receive unwanted junk mail on a daily basis. The app will help
      reduce the inflow of the snail mail, by creating an easy way to opt-out
      from the lists. 


      * Technical part of the project:


      Project will use the JavaScript programming language on the Ionic
      framework. The Ionic framework allows us to write the code for both IOS
      and Android platforms.


      The app will also contain a specific application programming interface
      (API) and optical character recognition (OCR). Alongside the API and the
      OCR algorithms, the app will have several databases for different
      purposes.
