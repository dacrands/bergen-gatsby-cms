title: Whiten Color Transfer in Tensorflow
image: /img/screen-shot-2019-08-05-at-3.14.25-pm.png
abstract: >
  This is an implementation of Whiten Colour Transfer in Tensorflow. A computer
  program that can paint over any image with the style of any other image
  instantly! No retraining required! It incorporates multiple algorithms and
  settings to allow the user to customize​ the artwork generated. These modes
  and settings are as follows…


  1)WCT – Whiten Colour Transfer (Transfers relevant features between images)


  2) adaIN – Arbitrary Style Transfer (Transfers lighting, colour, and relevant
  textures between images)


  3)swap5 – Swap5 algorithm (Transfers all features between images)


  4) KPT – Keep Original Colours (Transfers the style, but not the colour)

      **What can it do so far?**


      Stylise images and videos using a Command Line Interface (command prompt
      with python)


      Stylise images using a Graphical User Interface (GUI python)


      Train standard (not optimised) models in Python


      **To do:**


      1. Compress and distil models in python

      2. Convert Tensorflow python code to Tensorflow.js code

      3. Make a javascript implementation of Koby_WCT-TF and make it run
      locally. (on your PC)

      4. Add that to wordpress via wp-code. (see plugins wp-code)

      5. Make it pretty

      6. Make it mobile via web

      7. Make it a native App for android

      8. Make it a native App for iOS

      **What Happened This week?**


      Retrained models in python unsuccessfully. Try it again later.


      **To do:**


      1. Retrain models in python

      2. Compress and distil models in python

      3. Convert Tensorflow python code to Tensorflow.js code

      4. Make a javascript implementation of Koby_WCT-TF and make it run
      locally. (on your PC)

      5. Add that to wordpress via wp-code. (see plugins wp-code)

      6. Make it pretty

      7. Make it mobile via web

      8. Make it a native App for android

      9. Make it a native App for iOS
