    title: The experiment begins

      Today, we started with the initial trials for the new free-fall experiment
      setting up the experiment apparatus and shooting the video through
      different cell phone cameras. First off, we collected a few items that can
      be dropped from a height slightly higher than 2 meters. We found a golf
      ball, a wooden ball and a small steel ball. In figure 1, you can see the
      slow motion video of the first trial taken using iPhone 7 with 720p and
      240fps of the golf ball dropped from above the door height. Figure 2 shows
      the second trial taken using Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge with the same quality.
      We thought it was important to try taking the slow-motion video in
      different cell-phones because we were checking to see if it was feasible
      for students to take their own videos in class to perform the experiment.
      Now, we're going to try to use different apps and software such as PASCO
      that will allow the students to analyze the video and find measurements
      and other information for the calculations.
