      Today, we started with the initial trials for the new free-fall experiment
      setting up the experiment apparatus and shooting the video through
      different cell phone cameras. First off, we collected a few items that can
      be dropped from a height slightly higher than 2 meters. 




      We found a golf ball, a wooden ball and a small steel ball. In figure 1,
      you can see the slow motion video of the first trial taken using iPhone 7
      with 720p and 240fps of the golf ball dropped from above the door height.
      Figure 2 shows the second trial taken using Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge with
      the same quality. We thought it was important to try taking the
      slow-motion video in different cell-phones because we were checking to see
      if it was feasible for students to take their own videos in class to
      perform the experiment. Now, we're going to try to use different apps and
      software such as PASCO that will allow the students to analyze the video
      and find measurements and other information for the calculations.

      In trials including a golf ball, steel ball, and wooden ball using both
      iPhone and Samsung cameras, the group found that the steel ball showed the
      most accurate value for acceleration due to gravity, 9.79 +/- 0.09 m/s2 
      while g for the golf ball was 9.41 +/1 0.10 m/s2.  




      This may be evidence that air resistance plays a part in the general error
      presented during the experimentation. Overall, the data found from these
      first few determinations showed that the experiment can be validated since
      the data is congruent with theoretical values and known values. In
      conclusion, further testing must be done to finalize the process for the
      experiment.
