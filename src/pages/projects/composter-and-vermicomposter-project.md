abstract: >-
  We pursue sustainable resources for a better future for lives and the earth.

  We've decided to contribute to the pursuit of sustainability by participating
  in the Composing Rocket Project among many activities that we can choose. Our
  project sees food waste, which was considered waste, as a renewable resource.
  When we get nutrient soil, weâ€™ll get healthy food using the nutrient soil.
meeting: Coming soon
