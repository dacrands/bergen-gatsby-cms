  We pursue sustainable resources for a better future for lives and the earth.

  We've decided to contribute to the pursuit of sustainability by participating
  in the Composing Rocket Project among many activities that we can choose. Our
  project sees food waste, which was considered waste, as a renewable resource.
  When we get nutrient soil, weâ€™ll get healthy food using the nutrient soil.

      Almost all models are built. One problem, however, is that the warehouse
      for the vermi-composting model is slightly smaller than the model. It is
      difficult to place an engine that can move the heavy contents back and
      forth.


      Now temperature graph of each channel shows down slope without bend.
      However, the ideal situation is that the graph of the temperature
      represented by each channel shows the shape of the mountain as the second
      channel has the highest temperature. The cause for down slope is likely to
      be due to small amount of waste. There is a limit to the amount of food
      waste that can be collected in the school during the summer term. We
      always bring food waste from Dunkin 'Donuts on campus, and coffee and
      grass clippings are the main thing. I am worried that the coffee will
      oxidize the product since there is a lot of coffee.

      Cleaning ")

       We cleaned the machine. Cleaning the machine was well done, but one piece of drain is lost and we are going to separate the pipe in the drain for a second. It is not expected to have a significant impact on the machine, personally.
