  We pursue sustainable resources for a better future for lives and the earth.

  We've decided to contribute to the pursuit of sustainability by participating
  in the Composing Rocket Project among many activities that we can choose. Our
  project sees food waste, which was considered waste, as a renewable resource.
  When we get nutrient soil, we’ll get healthy food using the nutrient soil.

      Finally, we got some good results. The color is dark black and it is
      moist. It has little chunk of wood chips which will be break down by worms
      but still look nice.


      On July 22, the temperature of the second channel rose to 67°C degrees.
      Although this week's weather were hotter than the day(32°C), the second
      channel has not increased to 67°C. Thus, the interior of the machine can
      affected not only the temperature of the weather but also the humidity.


      This week's temperature changes are interesting. According to the
      instructions, the second machine would be 60-70°C degrees, the third
      channel 60-30°C, and the fourth 30°C or less. On Monday, it was again
      unstable due to a monotonous down hill trend, but after that, it turned
      out to be a mountain shape that changed on the second channel. In
      addition, the difference between the first channel and the second channel
      is more stable than the former (1°C degree difference) approximately an
      average of 6°C degrees. On the other hand, the temperature of the fourth
      channel(50°C) should cool down a lot to be less that 30°C. 

       I'm worried that the pH of product is little bit alkaline. Earthworms prefer pH of 5.5-8. But now pH of product is 8.5, generally a little out of range at pH of 8.5. The reason has yet to be revealed.

      Compared to last week, humidity was much improved. Now the fog has
      developed enough to cause the field of view to become cloudy.

      We set up a voltage with mentor to see if the machine works well. We
      switched the voltage number to temperature using types n and k, but it
      does not match current temperature. It is difficult to see that there is a
      problem with the machine because the machine produces satisfactory
      results. At first, We decided to stop measuring the voltage.


      I can turn the machine's internal propeller by pressing the manual button.
      We figured out that it takes 46 seconds per one round. Furthermore, we
      need to check that it is actually take about two weeks for the soil to
      come out as written in the manual.

      The machine is more active than ever before, but the amount of food waste
      is still lacking. I expect that in the new semester it will bring a better
      performance by having more food waste.

       The pH of most objects are fine. But, we have found that the product is somewhat little bit basic. The pH of product is 8.85. Although it is not to a serious degree, the red wiggler earthworms prefer pH levels from 5.5 to 8. We expect coffee will serve as a buffer by suppling plenty of acidic coffee.

      There have also been many improvements in the product condition. It looks
      more moist. But, I see a piece of less disintegrated wood. We discussed it
      would be better to use wood chips that was more shattered.

      The first channel of temperature is similar to the second channel. It is a
      good signal. On the afternoon of the 23rd, the second channel finally
      passed the temperature of the first channel. The first channel is 61, the
      second channel is 63.

      We started to measure the pH. The pH is one of the important factors like
      temperature. Especially, it is important to maintain proper pH because the
      product will be eaten by earthworms. Wood chips, food waste in the
      machine, and soil were measured on 15th. All are within the appropriate
      level.

      The soil is still arid. The cause are probably the amount of food to be
      fed to the machine, and the amount of water. The fact that the hose was
      just ready is also affected. Until now, if the ratio was about total mass
      for food waste and wood chips to water is 2: 1, 1: 1 will be added to the
      total amount of feed soon.

      On July 6, when I got temperature after putting water into machine, the
      temperature was lowered by 11.6 degrees. I had been worried that this will
      affect maintaining the proper temperature inside the machine. However,
      since the supply of food is much larger these days, the temperature does
      not change much even after watering. This will have a good effect on
      microorganisms.

      after watering : 56.8 °C ")


      On the 16th day, the hose was broken. All hoses should be carefully
      wrapped so that they are not cut by the mower.

      Almost all models are built. One problem, however, is that the warehouse
      for the vermi-composting model is slightly smaller than the model. It is
      difficult to place an engine that can move the heavy contents back and
      forth.


      Now temperature graph of each channel shows down slope without bend.
      However, the ideal situation is that the graph of the temperature
      represented by each channel shows the shape of the mountain as the second
      channel has the highest temperature. The cause for down slope is likely to
      be due to small amount of waste. There is a limit to the amount of food
      waste that can be collected in the school during the summer term. We
      always bring food waste from Dunkin 'Donuts on campus, and coffee and
      grass clippings are the main thing. I am worried that the coffee will
      oxidize the product since there is a lot of coffee.


      ![](/img/screen-shot-2019-08-21-at-2.40.51-pm.png "Before and After
      Cleaning ")

       We cleaned the machine. Cleaning the machine was well done, but one piece of drain is lost and we are going to separate the pipe in the drain for a second. It is not expected to have a significant impact on the machine, personally.

      One of the problems in last year was the drain. But, more precisely, there
      was a problem with the fan in the drain hole, and the water was not
      discharged properly, which is different from the present case. I hope
      there is no big problem because the drainage is smooth now.

      **Building the Vermicomposter**


      We have been attempting to figure out how to build the Vermicomposter
      since last Wednesday (July 3rd.)  As of today, it is still incomplete, but
      is far more along than it has ever been in the years since it's been
      ordered.  Unfortunately, the directions that came along with the composter
      were extremely unclear and did not specify how and where things were put
      together, leaving us to deduce the construction of the machine ourselves. 
      We hope to get it done by this time next week, but Murphy's Law was not
      kind to us so far.  Hope for the best and prepare for the worst!  The
      following will be pictures of our progress so far.
