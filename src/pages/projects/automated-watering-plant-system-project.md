  The AWPS project is being implemented in order to water plants automatically
  without having to be present. This will hopefully lower the chances of plants
  dying in the future due to mistreatment. The system will also have access to
  smartphone capabilities. It will make use of the Raspberries piâ€™s network
  capabilities and have its own web server to receive commands online.
meeting: '10 AM -- 3 PM, Monday --Thursday in S-327'
