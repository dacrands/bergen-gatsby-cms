title: 'AWPS: Automatic Watering Plant System'
image: /img/automated-water.jpg
abstract: >-
  The AWPS project is being implemented in order to water plants automatically
  without having to be present. This will hopefully lower the chances of plants
  dying in the future due to mistreatment. The system will also have access to
  smartphone capabilities. It will make use of the Raspberries pi’s network
  capabilities and have its own web server to receive commands online.

      The first phase of the project was almost finished. We were now capable of
      watering the plant through voice commands and touch screen inputs. We
      created a mobile app that could control the system and everything was
      being monitored by the Raspberry pi. We spray painted the plant system
      cover, and got a cabinet (which we made custom changes to) to make it
      displayable. I created a speech for the week and showed everyone our work!

      We started to completely sync all of the apps together to make it smooth
      and seamless. We tried to predict the issues we might have with the
      school’s network and iron out those issues. We installed an indicator
      light to show us if there were issues with the app while we were talking
      to the plant system and waterproofed the tank.

      Figured out a way to detect the water level without drilling holes in the
      water tank. We came out with a final design and added voice recognition to
      the project. We went with AWS because of its extensive libraries and
      tutorials. It was a steep learning curve but we ended up mastering it and
      being able to update a database based on what we said to Alexa. It was
      just what we needed. Now we just needed to configure the Raspberry pi to
      read all of the information that Alexa was putting on the server.

      We started working on the 3D design and tried to improve it since we know
      to some extent which sensors we needed. The only problem was we still
      needed a way to detect the water levels in a tank. There was also an issue
      related to the inputs on the Raspberry pi. It didn’t have analog reads so
      we needed to purchase an Arduino and sync it with the Raspberry.

      We started furthering on the mobile design for the application and tried
      syncing it with the database. We added a list of plants for the mobile app
      and a way to monitor and control the plant through mobile means. We also
      had problems though. We had issues trying to figure out how we could use
      the Raspberry pi in order to detect changes in the database. We were also
      having connectivity issues which we needed a turnaround for.

      During the first week we started designing the functionality of the robot.
      We split the project into three phases but for the first phase we figured
      out how all sensors were going to fit together. We analyzed the services
      we were going to be using and tried to figure out how much this was all
      going to cost and what my limits were going to be. We even started
      implementing the mobile design for this project.
