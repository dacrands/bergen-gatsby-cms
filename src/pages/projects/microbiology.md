      This week was focused on consolidation of all of our data and preparation
      of our poster and presentation.

      We filled in any last gaps in our data, including all antibiotics and
      natural oils. We were unable to continue DNA extraction and PCR as we ran
      out of those resources. We will continue this part during the fall
      semester.

  - body: "Peppermint oils, Tea tree oil, and lavender oil were tested amongst the samples. Tea tree seemed to be the strongest in this trial. \r\n\nUpon realizing ampicillin and penicillin were missing, we tested those as well."

  - body: "Gram stains were further examined. To confirm S. aureus, we performed a coagulase test. We mixed the sample into a test tube filled with coagulase. If the coagulase turned solid, it was positive. If the coagulase stayed a liquid, then it was negative.\r\n\nWe continued filling in our data sheet for all antibiotics and samples tested. \r\n\nWe also transferred new mold samples and extracted their DNA and performed gel electrophoresis on these mold cellulase clones."

    title: 'Week 9 '
  - body: "We discovered quite a few presumptive positives, for which we prepared gram stains for microscope viewing. \r\n\nRed colonies indicated Gram negative, violet colonies indicated Gram positive. \r\n\nWe also extracted DNA from an air colony and a belly button sample. We looked for the EU bacter gene in these, however no positives turned up. \r\n\nZones of inhibition from new samples were collected, with tea tree oil averaging the strongest antimicrobial substance in this trial."

  - body: "More antibiotic testing with new samples collected from random surfaces around Bergen Community College. \r\n\nThese were placed on Mannitol Salt Agar, which is a bright red color. This helped differentiate between Staphylococcus aureus, which can cause MRSA, and Staphylococcus epiderdimis, which is harmless."

  - body: "All zones of inhibition were measured and recorded. The hand sanitizer was the weakest reagent. Chloramphenicol and novobiocin were tied for strongest. We continued prepping more antibiotic testing. \r\n\nWe also helped extract DNA from mold for another project. Procedures varied slightly from usual as mold cell walls are much more difficult to penetrate"

  - body: "PCR samples that were prepped the week before, were run through gel electrophoresis. Only SM/ERMA was positive. \r\n\nWe have prepped various agar plates with bacteria and more antibiotic and herbal discs. We tested streptomycin, amoxicillin, Chloramphenicol, doxycycline, kanamycin,  erythromycin, novobiocin, penicillin, thieves hand sanitizer, a thieves oil, lavender oil, Peppermint oil, and lavender oil."

    image: /img/screen-shot-2019-08-27-at-1.59.35-pm.png
  - body: "We prepped more samples for PCR, focusing in on the following genes: TETK, ERMA, TETM, and AAAC. \r\n\nWe have discovered a few positives, in our samples LA/TETK, ARI/ERMA, MLSV/AAAC, and MSLV/ERMA. \r\n\nTo further our examination, we began gel electrophoresis. This procedure requires 5 µL of each sample mixture inserted into a designated spot, and then ultraviolet light allows the results to be read after it is run. We discovered a 475 fragment in two samples, BASV/AAAC and NA/AAAC. This was sent away for testing."

  - body: "Now we begin PCR testing. We were checking for a certain antibiotic resistant gene, TETK, in our S. Aureus isolates. \r\n\nWe mixed the solutions, and centrifuged them to extract the DNA. \r\n\nWe continued this process for multiple samples, and multiple gene primers."

      We swab samples of air and various tongue bacteria with an inoculating
      loop and transferred to agar plates. We then sectioned quadrants on the
      plates and labeled each one with a certain antibiotic, then placed a disc
      with the antibiotic accordingly. We repeated the procedure with disks
      soaking in herbal remedy solutions including Brilliant Green, Propolis,
      Calendula tea, and Iodine. 


      We then did the same with Staph Aureus. 


      After incubating these plates overnight, we measured inhibition rings and
      examined bacterial growth around the antibiotic and herbal remedy discs. 


      Out of seven people tested, we found two people with presumptive positives
      for Staph Aureus. The samples were mixed into coagulase and examined after
      four hours to confirm.

  - body: "Our group sat in on Dr. Jimenez’s microbiology lab. Proper behavior and procedures involving sanitation and handling of specimens were discussed. We sanitized lab tables with sodium hypochloride (bleach) and began practicing experiments. \r\n\nWe learned how to take swabs, grow them in agar plates, broths, and slants. \r\n\nWe scraped these colonies after incubating them overnight and fixated them onto glass slides to make various stains. These procedures included gram, spore, and simple stains."
