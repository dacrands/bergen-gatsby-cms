title: Implementing Parallel Processing on Desktop Clusters
image: /img/parallel-processing.jpeg
abstract: >-
  Following success in designing and building a 4-unit Raspberry Pi cluster, we
  scaled the design up to include 8 nodes. We then proceeded to design and build
  a desktop PC version utilizing 11 available desktop machines.  This is being
  done to achieve penalization for processing information to achieve industrial
  and professional performance to commutate large, computational intensive
  information for Bergen Community College STEM to utilize.
