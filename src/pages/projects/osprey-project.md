abstract: >-
  The objective of the study is five-fold: 1.) Determine if scavenging behavior
  of coastal Ospreys is more consistent than past research claims 2.) Study the
  diet and feeding habits of Ospreys 3.) Use Ospreys as indicators to determine
  ecosystem health of Sandy Hook bay/shore area 4.) Capture and document
  images/official sightings of Osprey scavenging behavior 5.) Study Osprey
  vocalizations during their development (not well documented)

  - body: "**Discoveries**\n\n* All (2) active Osprey nests were found in the chimneys of Fort Hancock’s old housing, at the tip of the hook\r\n* The manmade nests that were created for them are further inland, and, for some reason, are vacant, suggesting there’s a reason the Ospreys are not nesting there. Ospreys typically do not live in colonies and prefer to be spread out from their ‘neighbors’, and yet they are moving more and more towards the tip of sandy hook and away from the rest of the island.\r\n* Near the vacant Osprey nests were an abundance of vultures, at least 4 or 5, feeding on dead bird and fish carcasses.\r\n* One Osprey was seen flying above the area of the vacant Osprey nest and the feeding vultures, appearing to be scoping it out, but never landed in the area.\r\n\n**In addition**\r\n\n* Male and female Ospreys are difficult to distinguish from one another, so rather than referring to mother or father Ospreys, they will be referred to as parent Ospreys\r\n* Osprey vocalizations sound almost paedomorphic (The parent Osprey’s vocalizations were originally thought to be chicks cheeping)\r\n* Baby Osprey vocalizations are raspier, less clear, and higher pitched\r\n\n**Shortfalls**\r\n\n* Long island that takes time to navigate\r\n* Ospreys are condensed at the far end of the island, requiring further travel\r\n* Ospreys are nested in chimneys taller than any surrounding trees, further investigation will be required to find sufficient locations to place the trap cams\r\n\n**Errors**\r\n\n* Only two of the three trap cameras were working\r\n* Set up a trap cam at a vacant nest for hours\r\n* Only set up one trap cam at an active nesting site, but not for a sufficient time to properly document their behavior\r\n\n**Corrections**\r\n\n* More trap cams\r\n* Batteries (and sim cards) for all trap cams\r\n* Only set up trap cams at visibly active sites\r\n* Leave trap cams for longer duration\r\n* Edit trap cam settings to record for longer periods of time rather than short intervals\r\n* Try to record any Osprey/Vulture interactions, as well as developing Ospreys’ vocalizations\r\n\n**Still need**\r\n\n* Batteries\r\n* More trap cams\r\n* Gloves\r\n* Measuring tape\r\n* Sim card reader"

  - body: "* Two more active Osprey nests were found in the chimneys of Fort Hancock’s old housing, at the tip of the hook, resulting in a total of four active nests discovered\r\n* Common theme of preference for chimneys over manmade nesting posts, possibly for stability, security, or closer to food source.\r\n* More vultures were spotted feeding on dead bird, fish and deer carcasses.\r\n* Nests that appeared empty on the last expedition now had Osprey pairs, suggesting that either the parents stay out of the nest for long periods of time, or that Ospreys are still pairing up and breeding well into the month of June.\r\n* Certain buildings have easy to reach, clear-viewed locations where Ospreys can be observed, more to be discovered\r\n\n**In addition**\r\n\n* Male and female osprey parents can be differentiated from one another by which bird brings food (males) and which bird tries to solicit food through begging calls (females).\r\n\n**Shortfalls**\r\n\n* Long island that takes time to navigate\r\n* Ospreys are condensed at the far end of the island, requiring further travel\r\n* Information on Osprey (and vulture and deer) population numbers from previous years is kept by park rangers, but is not accessible to the public\r\n\n**Errors**\r\n\n* Only one of the three trap cameras had accessible, working SD cards\r\n* The one working SD card captured a day’s worth of footage but the footage was mostly blocked my branches\r\n* The one working trap cam also was set to daytime mode, did not capture nighttime footage as intended\r\n\n**Corrections**\r\n\n* More trap cams\r\n* Batteries (and sim cards) for all trap cams\r\n* Only set up trap cams at visibly active sites\r\n* Leave trap cams for longer duration\r\n* Edit trap cam settings to record for longer periods of time rather than short intervals\r\n* Set all trap cams to 24-hr instead of day mode\r\n* Try to record any Osprey/Vulture interactions, as well as Osprey/nocturnal animal interactions and  developing Ospreys’ vocalizations\r\n\n**Still need**\r\n\n* Batteries\r\n* Trap cams\r\n* SD cards\r\n* Gloves\r\n* Measuring tape"
