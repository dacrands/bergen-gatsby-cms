  The objective of the study is five-fold: 1.) Determine if scavenging behavior
  of coastal Ospreys is more consistent than past research claims 2.) Study the
  diet and feeding habits of Ospreys 3.) Use Ospreys as indicators to determine
  ecosystem health of Sandy Hook bay/shore area 4.) Capture and document
  images/official sightings of Osprey scavenging behavior 5.) Study Osprey
  vocalizations during their development (not well documented)
