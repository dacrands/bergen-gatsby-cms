  The use of supplements to enhance training is redefining how individuals
  workout. Health food companies suggest that using different supplements will
  allow for better results including increased muscle growth, faster recovery,
  and more energy while exercising. Social media influencers and trainers
  regularly promote the use of supplements and a healthy diet to achieve the
  same results they have. On the contrary, there are some trainers and
  influencers who firmly believe that a healthy diet alone will promote the same
  results. Many people who are just embarking on their workout journey are
  confused about whether or not to use supplements such as whey- casein protein
  powder, creatine, and branched-chain​ amino acids (BCAA’s). The question that
  we are answering is whether or not these supplements will promote more muscle
  growth, greater fat loss, increased energy, and faster recovery. Is it better
  to introduce different supplements or to go the old fashion way and eat
  nutritional foods? The research that will be conducted will test whether or
  not supplements are beneficial.

      In order to get participants, we must send out surveys to select who can
      be a part of our study. Currently, we are looking for students, faculty,
      or staff members of Bergen Community College who do not have any physical,
      health, or dietary restrictions. We are trying to recruit healthy
      individuals that have a beginner or intermediate understanding of
      exercising and eating healthy. It has been decided that we will send out
      an initial survey, a PARQ, a consent form and a weekly survey. We added on
      overview of each survey below.

  - body: >-
      It is essential to create a workout plan for the participants. It was
      decided that the participants will workout every other day and focus on
      nine different muscle groups. The nine muscle groups are biceps, triceps,
      shoulders, chest, back, quadriceps, hamstrings, calves, and glutes. 


      The workout plan will be eight weeks long. The workouts are spilt up 3
      days per week in a two week cycle. Every two weeks, the participants will
      repeat the same workout. The main goal to gain muscle. 


      The workout plan will look like this:

    title: 'Week 2 '
  - body: "Ex_Sups met for the first time. The group met with Luis DeAbreu and Danielle Coppola who is the head of Bergen’s Exercise Science department. It was a brief meeting to simply go over the project’s initial proposal.\n\n* **Background:**\r\n\nIt has been concluded from preliminary research that whey- casein protein powder, creatine, and branch chained amino acids (BCCA’s) are the most common supplements used to elevated one’s results when exercising. Whey- casein protein powder is a very popular supplement. It is used to aid in muscle recovery and to make enzymes and hormones. Being an essential macro-nutrient, individuals feel the need to consume high amounts of it. Is it really necessary to introduce a powder into a person’s diet or is it better to eat food high in protein? Creatine is used to enhance performance during exercise. It is naturally found in muscle cells although the idea of implementing creatine into individuals’ diet is controversial. It is used to increase muscle mass and strength. Creatine is found is several foods such as eggs, red meat, and poultry. Branched Chain Amino Acids are usually taken as a pre-workout. Our bodies are made up of 20 different amino acids and are split into essential amino acids and nonessential amino acids. We naturally produce three essential amino acids including valine, leucine, and isoleucine. They are converted to energy and prevent muscle proteins from breaking down. These additional amino acids are said to aid in soreness and prevent excessive muscle damage after putting the body under pressure.\r\n\n* **Method:**\r\n\nIn order to determine the benefits of additional supplements there will be two groups of test subjects. One group will receive supplements to add to their routine while the control group will not receive any supplements. The test group will be given each questioned supplement either before, during, or after their workout. Both groups will be given the same workout plan and will\r\n\nhave similar eating habits to eliminate other variables. The progress will be tracked by recording the weight of the individuals throughout the trial. It is integral to track the food consumed to be aware of how many calories were consumed. We will examine the circumference of the wait, upper arm, and lower body to access muscle gain or fat loss. Additionally, pictures will be taken to visually compare weekly results. We will take measurements on a smart scale which measures weight, body fat, and bone density can be used.\r\n\n* **In the Future:**\r\n\nDepending on the results obtained, further testing can be conducted on the effects of organic supplements versus non-organic supplements. The role of gender can also be tested such as, does one supplement have more of an effect on a female rather than a male.\r\r\n\nDanielle loved the idea- she thinks that we will be able to gain the support of a bunch of exercise science students. The next time we meet, we will be meeting with Professor Julie Seda. Our proposal looks good but we cannot start anything until we figure out every minute detail to submit to the Internal Review Board (IRB). The IRB is a board of Bergen Community College staff and faculty who make sure research projects are safe and ethical  for the participants. \r\n\n\rThe Ex_Sups team met with Professor Julie Seda. We discussed what workout supplement we would like to test on the participants. There are so many supplements on the market that it is overwhelming to choose one. We originally were interested in analyzing either preworkout, Branched Chain Amino Acids (BCAA’s), Creatine, or protein. We decided to just look at the effects of protein. \r\n\nProtein powder is used to aid in muscle recovery, make enzymes and produce hormones. Protein is made of twenty different amino acids. Of those twenty, the body naturally produces eleven of them and the other nine, called essential amino acids, are found in food sources known as complete proteins. The nine essential amino acids include:  histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. Not all food sources are complete proteins. Foods such as egg whites and red meat contain all nine amino acids are considered complete proteins. Incomplete proteins include beans and grains which do not contain all essential amino acids.  These amino acids found in protein sources will be used by the body for energy to cellular growth and muscle recovery.  Without adequate amounts of this macro- nutrient, the body will not be replacing and producing muscles cells as efficiently as possible. \r\n\nBeing that protein is an essential macro-nutrient, individuals feel the need to consume high amounts of it. From preliminary research, it has been concluded it is typically recommended that within 30 minutes after working out, an individual should consume 0.25-0.30grams of protein per each kilogram of body weight. Typically, this equates to consuming between 15 to 25 grams of protein. It is important to consume this additional protein within 30 minutes of working out because this is when the recovery process begins. Weight training puts stress on the individual’s muscles. The stress of the weight on old muscle fibers will cause them to break before forming new, stronger muscle fibers.. It is important to consume complete proteins after working out to ensure that the body is receiving all essential amino acids for muscle growth. \r\n\nFrom this analysis, we decided to study protein.  It would be easiest to compare the muscle growth of participants who consumed protein up to 30 mins after working out to those who consumed a placebo up to 30 mins after working out."

    title: 'Week 1 '
  - body: "Measurements are going to be a crucial part to determine muscle growth. The researchers must follow a very particular protocol when taking the measurements on the participants. \r\n\n* **4-site skinfold body fat measurement with Caliper:**\r\n\n Helpful video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iswCHPi_0Gs\r\n\n Grasp the handle with right hand, numbers facing the ceiling, and place thumb on trigger. For each measurement press lever and place on skinfold. Once placed, release trigger and allow caliper to grasp skin. Measurements will be done on the right side of the subjects body. \r\n\nEach subject will have the option to remove their shirt for each measurement. Although optional, results could be skewed if shirts remain on. \r\n\n* **Measurements:**\r\n\n1.\tTricep- A tape measure will be used to find the halfway point between the top of the shoulder and top of the elbow. The halfway point will be marked with a marker on the side of the arm and then transferred to the back. Place caliper above the mark and grab the skin above the mark while separating the subcutaneous fat from muscle. Vertical Fold.\r\n\n2.\tSuprailiac- Ask subject to find top of hip bone. Measure one inch above the iliac crest in the front of the body. Diagonal fold. \r\n\n3.\t Abdominal- Measure one inch from the subjects belly button. Vertical fold. \r\n\n4.\tThigh- Locate the halfway point between the groin and knee using a tape measure and mark it. Ask subject to lift leg up to help find the hip bone. Have subject rest body weight on left side. Measure 1 inch above mark. This measurement may cause further pinching of the skin. Vertical fold.\r\n\n* **Girth Measurements:**\r\n\nHelpful video and textbook: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Haf1eBDrSCY and Functional Testing in Human Performance Written by Michael P. Reiman \r\n\nPrior to each measurement, mark each site. This test will be used to analyze proportionality. Equipment used for these measurements includes a fabric tape measure and scale. It is crucial to be consistent with the amount of tension on the tape measure throughout each measurement.\r\n\n* **Measurements:**\r\n\n1.\tWaist circumference measurement- This measurement is taken between the ribs and the hips. Place tape measure around the smallest area of the subject, this may vary among each participant. Ask subject to hold end of tape and walk around and wrap measuring tape. Hold tape together and have a little tension. Line the zero up with the other end of the tape measure.  \r\n\n2.\tChest-  Ask subject to raise arms and approach the subject from the front. Wrap tape measure around the back and along nipple line. Subject will now place arms on their side. \r\n\n3.\tHips- Subject will turn to the side. Wrap the tape measure around the greatest protrusion of the gluteal muscles (Reiman). \r\n\n4.\tArm (relaxed)- Mark midpoint from top of shoulder until the bony part of the elbow. Wrap tape measure around the mark. \r\n\n5.\tArm (flexed)- Ask subject to raise arm in a horizontal position and bend elbow 90 degrees. Ask subject to contract muscle. Wrap tape measure around the largest circumference. \r\n\n6.\tUpper thigh- Mark midpoint from the iliac crest to the top of the knee. Wrap tape measure around the midpoint. \r\n\n7.\tCalf- Mark midpoint from the top of their tibia to their ankle joint. Wrap tape measure around the mark. \r\n\n* **Bioimpedance:**\r\n\nPrior to each measurement, subject should remove shoes and stand completely still throughout the duration of the test. This scale will provide measurements such as body fat percentage, body mass index (BMI), skeletal muscle, resting metabolism, visceral fat, body age and body weight. These measurements should be quick and easy as long as instructions are followed, refer instruction manual if more information is necessary. \r\n\nHelpful instructions: https://omronhealthcare.com/products/body-composition-monitor-scale-seven-indicators-hbf516b/\r\n\n* **Equipment used: Body Composition Monitor And Scale With Seven Fitness Indicators**\r\n\n1.\tTurn on monitor \r\n\n2.\tSelect guest mode and enter information. \r\n\n3.\tStep on unit barefoot. Line heel and feet up with electrodes and make sure body weight is evenly distributed.\r\n\na.\tWeight measurement will be taken. Once weight results blinks twice, the monitor will begin to calculate body composition. \r\n\n4.\tStand with knees and back straight.\r\n\n5.\tHorizontally raise arms and extend elbows completely (90 degree angle). \r\n\n6.\tWeight will be displayed again which indicates that each measurement is done. \r\n\n7.\tTo check results, click proper button on monitor. Results will be held in the history folder on the monitor."
