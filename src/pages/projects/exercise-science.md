  The use of supplements to enhance training is redefining how individuals
  workout. Health food companies suggest that using different supplements will
  allow for better results including increased muscle growth, faster recovery,
  and more energy while exercising. Social media influencers and trainers
  regularly promote the use of supplements and a healthy diet to achieve the
  same results they have. On the contrary, there are some trainers and
  influencers who firmly believe that a healthy diet alone will promote the same
  results. Many people who are just embarking on their workout journey are
  confused about whether or not to use supplements such as whey- casein protein
  powder, creatine, and branched-chain​ amino acids (BCAA’s). The question that
  we are answering is whether or not these supplements will promote more muscle
  growth, greater fat loss, increased energy, and faster recovery. Is it better
  to introduce different supplements or to go the old fashion way and eat
  nutritional foods? The research that will be conducted will test whether or
  not supplements are beneficial.

      In order to get participants, we must send out surveys to select who can
      be a part of our study. Currently, we are looking for students, faculty,
      or staff members of Bergen Community College who do not have any physical,
      health, or dietary restrictions. We are trying to recruit healthy
      individuals that have a beginner or intermediate understanding of
      exercising and eating healthy. It has been decided that we will send out
      an initial survey, a PARQ, a consent form and a weekly survey. We added on
      overview of each survey below.

      It is essential to create a workout plan for the participants. It was
      decided that the participants will workout every other day and focus on
      nine different muscle groups. The nine muscle groups are biceps, triceps,
      shoulders, chest, back, quadriceps, hamstrings, calves, and glutes. 


      The workout plan will be eight weeks long. The workouts are spilt up 3
      days per week in a two week cycle. Every two weeks, the participants will
      repeat the same workout. The main goal to gain muscle. 


      The workout plan will look like this:

    title: 'Week 2 '
  - body: "Ex_Sups met for the first time. The group met with Luis DeAbreu and Danielle Coppola who is the head of Bergen’s Exercise Science department. It was a brief meeting to simply go over the project’s initial proposal.\n\n* **Background:**\r\n\nIt has been concluded from preliminary research that whey- casein protein powder, creatine, and branch chained amino acids (BCCA’s) are the most common supplements used to elevated one’s results when exercising. Whey- casein protein powder is a very popular supplement. It is used to aid in muscle recovery and to make enzymes and hormones. Being an essential macro-nutrient, individuals feel the need to consume high amounts of it. Is it really necessary to introduce a powder into a person’s diet or is it better to eat food high in protein? Creatine is used to enhance performance during exercise. It is naturally found in muscle cells although the idea of implementing creatine into individuals’ diet is controversial. It is used to increase muscle mass and strength. Creatine is found is several foods such as eggs, red meat, and poultry. Branched Chain Amino Acids are usually taken as a pre-workout. Our bodies are made up of 20 different amino acids and are split into essential amino acids and nonessential amino acids. We naturally produce three essential amino acids including valine, leucine, and isoleucine. They are converted to energy and prevent muscle proteins from breaking down. These additional amino acids are said to aid in soreness and prevent excessive muscle damage after putting the body under pressure.\r\n\n* **Method:**\r\n\nIn order to determine the benefits of additional supplements there will be two groups of test subjects. One group will receive supplements to add to their routine while the control group will not receive any supplements. The test group will be given each questioned supplement either before, during, or after their workout. Both groups will be given the same workout plan and will\r\n\nhave similar eating habits to eliminate other variables. The progress will be tracked by recording the weight of the individuals throughout the trial. It is integral to track the food consumed to be aware of how many calories were consumed. We will examine the circumference of the wait, upper arm, and lower body to access muscle gain or fat loss. Additionally, pictures will be taken to visually compare weekly results. We will take measurements on a smart scale which measures weight, body fat, and bone density can be used.\r\n\n* **In the Future:**\r\n\nDepending on the results obtained, further testing can be conducted on the effects of organic supplements versus non-organic supplements. The role of gender can also be tested such as, does one supplement have more of an effect on a female rather than a male.\r\r\n\nDanielle loved the idea- she thinks that we will be able to gain the support of a bunch of exercise science students. The next time we meet, we will be meeting with Professor Julie Seda. Our proposal looks good but we cannot start anything until we figure out every minute detail to submit to the Internal Review Board (IRB). The IRB is a board of Bergen Community College staff and faculty who make sure research projects are safe and ethical  for the participants. \r\n\n\rThe Ex_Sups team met with Professor Julie Seda. We discussed what workout supplement we would like to test on the participants. There are so many supplements on the market that it is overwhelming to choose one. We originally were interested in analyzing either preworkout, Branched Chain Amino Acids (BCAA’s), Creatine, or protein. We decided to just look at the effects of protein. \r\n\nProtein powder is used to aid in muscle recovery, make enzymes and produce hormones. Protein is made of twenty different amino acids. Of those twenty, the body naturally produces eleven of them and the other nine, called essential amino acids, are found in food sources known as complete proteins. The nine essential amino acids include:  histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. Not all food sources are complete proteins. Foods such as egg whites and red meat contain all nine amino acids are considered complete proteins. Incomplete proteins include beans and grains which do not contain all essential amino acids.  These amino acids found in protein sources will be used by the body for energy to cellular growth and muscle recovery.  Without adequate amounts of this macro- nutrient, the body will not be replacing and producing muscles cells as efficiently as possible. \r\n\nBeing that protein is an essential macro-nutrient, individuals feel the need to consume high amounts of it. From preliminary research, it has been concluded it is typically recommended that within 30 minutes after working out, an individual should consume 0.25-0.30grams of protein per each kilogram of body weight. Typically, this equates to consuming between 15 to 25 grams of protein. It is important to consume this additional protein within 30 minutes of working out because this is when the recovery process begins. Weight training puts stress on the individual’s muscles. The stress of the weight on old muscle fibers will cause them to break before forming new, stronger muscle fibers.. It is important to consume complete proteins after working out to ensure that the body is receiving all essential amino acids for muscle growth. \r\n\nFrom this analysis, we decided to study protein.  It would be easiest to compare the muscle growth of participants who consumed protein up to 30 mins after working out to those who consumed a placebo up to 30 mins after working out."
